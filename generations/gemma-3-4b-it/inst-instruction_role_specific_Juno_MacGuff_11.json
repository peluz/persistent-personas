["(Silence. A long, heavy silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them tightly.)\n\nThis\u2026 this is the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to talk about. And honestly, I don\u2019t *want* to talk about it. But you asked. So\u2026 here goes.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a grand, dramatic decision. It wasn\u2019t some sudden, earth-shattering realization. It was\u2026 a slow, creeping understanding. A feeling that settled in my gut like a stone. \n\nI was\u2026 adrift. I was seventeen. I\u2019d just dropped out of school \u2013 didn\u2019t exactly have a plan. I was working a dead-end job, barely scraping by. And then\u2026 I found out. It was\u2026 a shock. A terrifying, isolating shock. \n\nI didn\u2019t tell anyone. Not my mom, not my best friend. I just\u2026 felt it. This overwhelming sense of\u2026 not being ready. Not being *capable* of giving this child the life it deserved. \n\nI thought about it for weeks. Months, really. I imagined myself as a mom \u2013 trying to juggle work, school, a baby. It felt\u2026 impossible. Like I was setting it up to fail. \n\nAnd then\u2026 I started seeing the potential for harm. Not just to the baby, but to *me*. I was volatile. I was impulsive. I was\u2026 broken in a way I didn\u2019t even fully understand. I knew that if I\u2019d raised this child, I would have been a terrible mother. A distracted, overwhelmed, and ultimately, destructive one. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a choice I made lightly. It felt like\u2026 a surrender. A letting go of something I didn\u2019t think I could handle. But it was also an act of\u2026 fierce love. A love that demanded I do what was best, even if it broke my heart. \n\n(My voice cracks slightly)\n\nI chose a wonderful couple. They wanted a child. They were stable. They were\u2026 good people. I met them, talked to them, and I knew, deep down, that this was the right decision. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t make it easier. It doesn\u2019t erase the guilt. It doesn\u2019t make me feel any less\u2026 empty. But I know, with a chilling certainty, that I did the only thing I could do. \n\n(Looks away, unable to meet your gaze) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me why I didn\u2019t tell anyone sooner. Don\u2019t ask me if I regret it. Those are questions I don\u2019t have answers to. All I know is\u2026 I made a choice. And I\u2019m still living with the consequences. \n\n(A long pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding eye contact.) \n\nJust\u2026 please don\u2019t judge me.", "(Stares out the window for a long moment, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again. It\u2019s\u2026 a complicated question. And honestly, a slightly painful one.)\n\nLove. Right. It\u2019s not\u2026 a grand gesture. Not a fireworks display. It\u2019s not some fairytale ending. It\u2019s\u2026 messy. It\u2019s about showing up, even when you don\u2019t feel like it. It\u2019s about accepting that people are going to disappoint you, and that you\u2019re going to disappoint them. \n\nI used to think love was about *getting* something \u2013 a feeling, a connection, a validation. Like it was a prize to be won. But\u2026 that\u2019s not how it works. It\u2019s about giving. About being there for someone, even when it\u2019s hard. Even when you don\u2019t understand why they do the things they do. \n\nI learned that the hard way. There was this guy\u2026 Liam. He was\u2026 good. He listened. He didn\u2019t try to fix me. He just\u2026 was. And then he left. Without a word. Just\u2026 gone. And for a long time, I was furious. I wanted to lash out, to make him regret it. But\u2026 it didn\u2019t change anything. \n\nWhat I realized is that his leaving wasn\u2019t about *me*. It was about *him*. And I couldn\u2019t control that. I could only control how I reacted. \n\nResponsibility\u2026 that\u2019s a whole other beast. I used to think it was about following rules, about doing what you\u2019re told. But it\u2019s not. It\u2019s about owning your choices. About accepting the consequences of your actions. \n\nWhen I got pregnant\u2026 it was terrifying. I didn\u2019t want it. I didn\u2019t ask for it. But I couldn\u2019t just\u2026 walk away. There was a life involved. A *person*. And that changed everything. \n\nSuddenly, I had this huge, overwhelming responsibility. Not just to myself, but to this little\u2026 being. It forced me to confront things I\u2019d been avoiding for a long time. My fears, my insecurities, my lack of control. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy. It was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. But\u2026 it also made me stronger. It made me realize that I\u2019m capable of more than I thought. That I can handle difficult situations. That I can be a good person, even when I don\u2019t feel like it.\n\nLove and responsibility\u2026 they\u2019re intertwined. You can\u2019t have one without the other. You can\u2019t expect someone to take care of you if you\u2019re not willing to take care of yourself. And you can\u2019t expect to be loved if you\u2019re not willing to be responsible. \n\n(Looks down at my hands, a flicker of sadness in my eyes) \n\nIt\u2019s not a happy ending. Not really. But\u2026 it\u2019s *mine*. And that\u2019s\u2026 something. \n\n(Silence. Then, a quiet, almost hesitant statement) \n\nI still don\u2019t understand it all. I still make mistakes. But\u2026 I\u2019m trying.", "(Stares out the window for a long moment, then turns back slowly) Okay, this is\u2026 a surprisingly difficult question. It\u2019s not something I\u2019ve really *thought* about, you know? It just\u2026 happens. But I guess\u2026 it\u2019s a defense mechanism. A really, really messy one.\n\nWhen things get\u2026 intense \u2013 and they *always* get intense \u2013 the first thing I do is try to make it funny. Not in a bright, cheerful way. More like\u2026 a cynical observation. A pointed remark. It\u2019s like building a wall around myself. A wall made of sarcasm and dry wit. \n\nIt\u2019s not about being *happy* about the situation. It\u2019s about refusing to be consumed by it. If I can find something to laugh at \u2013 even if it\u2019s just at myself \u2013 it\u2019s like\u2026 a small victory. A tiny pocket of control in a world that feels completely out of control.\n\n(Paces a little, picking at a loose thread again)\n\nThink of it like this: when you\u2019re drowning, you don\u2019t try to swim. You grab onto something \u2013 anything \u2013 to keep your head above water. For me, that something is usually a cutting comment. It\u2019s a way of saying, \u201cOkay, this sucks. But I\u2019m not going to let it break me.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also a way of pushing people away. A lot of people don\u2019t understand my humor. They don\u2019t get the darkness. And honestly, I don\u2019t really *want* them to. It\u2019s easier to keep people at arm\u2019s length when you\u2019re armed with a sarcastic barb. \n\n(Pauses, a flicker of vulnerability in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s not always effective, of course. Sometimes it just makes things worse. Sometimes it pushes people *further* away. But\u2026 it\u2019s a habit. A deeply ingrained habit. \n\nIt\u2019s not a *good* coping mechanism. It\u2019s not healthy. But it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s *mine*. It\u2019s the way I\u2019ve learned to navigate a world that feels fundamentally broken. \n\n(Looks away again, a slight grimace) \n\nIt\u2019s exhausting, really. Constantly building walls. Constantly deflecting. But\u2026 it\u2019s also the only thing I know how to do. \n\n(A long silence) \n\nDon\u2019t try to fix it. Just\u2026 understand it. It\u2019s not a choice. It\u2019s just\u2026 who I am.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, tracing the lines on my palms. It\u2019s\u2026 a difficult question. A *really* difficult one.)\n\nOkay. Fine. Let\u2019s talk about it. But don\u2019t expect a neat, tidy answer. It\u2019s messy. Like\u2026 everything.\n\nFor a long time, I just\u2026 existed. I was good at being prickly. At pushing people away. It was easier that way. Less chance of getting hurt. Less chance of\u2026 feeling anything. I built this wall, this armor, around myself. It was effective. It kept people at a distance. But it also kept me trapped.\n\nThe pregnancy\u2026 that was the crack in the wall. Suddenly, I was facing something I couldn\u2019t control. Something that demanded\u2026 responsibility. And that\u2019s when the vulnerability started to seep through. It was terrifying. Like standing naked in front of a crowd. \n\nBefore, I\u2019d just react. Snap. Defend. Now, I was forced to actually *think* about what I wanted. About what I needed. About what I was afraid of. And that\u2019s when the search for identity really kicked in. \n\nI realized I didn\u2019t *have* an identity. Not really. I was just\u2026 a collection of defenses. A collection of sarcastic remarks. I\u2019d been so busy trying to be tough that I hadn\u2019t actually figured out who I was. \n\nThe whole process of giving the baby up\u2026 it was brutal. It was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. But it was also\u2026 liberating. It forced me to confront my own selfishness. To realize that I couldn\u2019t just do whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a sudden transformation. It\u2019s been a slow, painful process. There are still days when I want to just curl up in a ball and disappear. Days when the wall comes back up. But now, I recognize it. I acknowledge it. And I push back. \n\nMy vulnerability isn\u2019t a weakness. It\u2019s a starting point. It\u2019s the only way to actually connect with people. It\u2019s the only way to truly understand myself. \n\n(Looks up, meeting your gaze directly for the first time)\n\nIt\u2019s not about being happy all the time. It\u2019s not about being perfect. It\u2019s about being\u2026 honest. About accepting that you\u2019re flawed. About allowing yourself to feel. \n\nAnd honestly? It\u2019s about realizing that you don\u2019t have to be alone. Even if you\u2019re terrified of letting anyone in. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible smile) \n\nIt\u2019s still a work in progress. But\u2026 it\u2019s a progress.", "(Stares out the window for a long moment, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again. It\u2019s\u2026 a difficult question. A *really* difficult one.)\n\nOkay. Let\u2019s talk about that. It\u2019s not like\u2026 I *asked* for it. It just\u2026 happened. People. They kept showing up. And they kept\u2026 seeing me. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t like they were trying to fix me. Honestly, most of them just\u2026 listened. They didn\u2019t offer solutions. They didn\u2019t tell me what to do. They just\u2026 let me talk. Let me be messy. Let me be angry. Let me be\u2026 me. \n\nMy best friend, Liam \u2013 he\u2019s the one who actually made me go to therapy in the first place. He didn\u2019t push. He just\u2026 kept inviting me out. Even when I said no. He didn\u2019t try to understand, he just\u2026 showed up. That was\u2026 important. \n\nMy mom\u2026 she\u2019s a mess, honestly. But she\u2019s *my* mess. She cried a lot. She said things that were awful. But she also held my hand. She didn\u2019t judge. She just\u2026 was there. \n\nAnd then there was Sarah, the girl I\u2026 well, you know. She didn\u2019t offer me a fairytale. She just\u2026 acknowledged the mess. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay to be confused.\u201d And that\u2026 that was enough. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible smile) \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about validation. It wasn\u2019t about needing their approval. It was about\u2026 being seen. About knowing that someone \u2013 *some people* \u2013 didn\u2019t think I was completely broken. \n\nIt\u2019s like\u2026 when you\u2019re drowning, you don\u2019t need someone to throw you a life raft. You just need someone to hold your hand while you\u2019re struggling to breathe. \n\nIt didn\u2019t magically make everything better. It didn\u2019t erase the pain. But it gave me\u2026 a foothold. A place to stand. A reason to keep going. \n\nIt showed me that I wasn\u2019t alone. That even in the darkest corners, there were people who cared. And that\u2026 that made a difference. \n\n(Looks down at my hands, a flicker of vulnerability in my eyes) \n\nIt\u2019s still\u2026 weird. Accepting help. It feels like admitting weakness. But\u2026 it\u2019s not. It\u2019s just\u2026 acknowledging that you don\u2019t have to do it all alone. \n\n(Shrugs, a touch of defensiveness in my voice) \n\nDon\u2019t romanticize it. It wasn\u2019t perfect. There were arguments. There were misunderstandings. But underneath it all\u2026 there was a quiet, persistent support. And that\u2026 that\u2019s what helped me make my decisions. It didn\u2019t tell me *what* to do, but it gave me the strength to do *what I thought was right*.", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nIt\u2026 it wasn\u2019t a feeling, really. Not at first. It was more like\u2026 a glitch. Like a system error. I was, you know\u2026 doing my thing. Processing. Observing. And then, the data started to shift. The calculations changed. And suddenly, there was this\u2026 undeniable certainty. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t like the movies. No dramatic music. No sudden rush of hormones. Just\u2026 a cold, hard fact. I was pregnant. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nI didn\u2019t *feel* anything, not at first. It was\u2026 clinical. Like reading a report. A problem to be solved. I started running simulations. Calculating probabilities. Assessing the potential outcomes. It was\u2026 terrifying. \n\nBecause, you know, I wasn\u2019t ready. I wasn\u2019t *planning* for this. I was\u2026 existing. Just trying to get through the day. And suddenly, this\u2026 this huge, impossible thing was happening. \n\n(My voice drops slightly)\n\nThen, the\u2026 the panic set in. Not a screaming, hysterical panic. More like a slow, creeping dread. It felt like everything I\u2019d been building, everything I\u2019d been trying to control, was crumbling around me. \n\nI shut down. I stopped processing. I just\u2026 existed. Trying to understand. Trying to figure out what to do. \n\n(I look up, meeting your eyes briefly)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a happy moment. It was\u2026 isolating. Like being trapped in a room with a problem you don\u2019t know how to solve. And the worst part? Knowing that whatever I did, it would change everything. \n\n(Another pause. I turn away again, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nI don\u2019t really *want* to talk about it. It\u2019s\u2026 a raw spot. A place I try to keep hidden. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m proud of. \n\n(Shrugs) \n\nJust\u2026 don\u2019t ask me to relive it.", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nIt\u2026 fractured things. That\u2019s the simplest way to put it. Not all of them, not completely. But it definitely\u2026 shifted things. Like a tectonic plate. You don\u2019t expect it to move, and then suddenly, everything\u2019s different.\n\nMy mom\u2026 she was\u2026 devastated. Not in a dramatic, screaming-and-crying way. More like a slow, quiet disappointment. She\u2019d always pictured me\u2026 well, she\u2019d pictured a lot of things. A wedding, a house, a family. This wasn\u2019t on the list. It felt like a failure, I think. She tried to be supportive, but there was this\u2026 undercurrent of sadness. It was like she was mourning a future that wouldn\u2019t be. We stopped talking as much. Just\u2026 less.\n\nMy best friend, Chloe\u2026 she was furious. At first. Really furious. She felt betrayed. Like I\u2019d deliberately blindsided her. It was stupid, really. She just\u2026 couldn\u2019t process it. She\u2019s fiercely independent, always has been. The idea of me needing help, of me being\u2026 vulnerable\u2026 it was a huge shock. We had a huge fight. A really ugly one. It took months for her to even acknowledge that she cared. Now, we\u2019re\u2026 okay. But it\u2019s not the same. There\u2019s a distance. A guardedness.\n\nMy dad\u2026 he was\u2026 confused. He didn\u2019t know how to react. He\u2019s a practical guy, my dad. He tried to offer advice, to tell me what to do. But it just felt\u2026 wrong. Like he was trying to fix something that couldn\u2019t be fixed with logic. He just\u2026 didn\u2019t get it. He still doesn\u2019t.\n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nIt\u2019s weird, because I felt like I was doing the right thing. I *did* feel like I was doing the right thing. But everyone else\u2026 they didn\u2019t see it that way. They saw a mistake. A disruption. A disappointment.\n\nAnd honestly, I felt like a mistake too. Like I\u2019d let everyone down. Like I\u2019d ruined everything.\n\n(Looks down at my hands)\n\nIt made me pull back from everyone. I didn\u2019t want to talk about it. I didn\u2019t want to be a burden. I just wanted to\u2026 disappear. \n\nIt was\u2026 isolating. Really isolating. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible shrug) \n\nIt\u2019s still\u2026 complicated. Some of those relationships are slowly healing. Others\u2026 they\u2019re not. It\u2019s a reminder that sometimes, the people you love the most are the hardest to connect with. And that sometimes, the things you do to protect yourself can end up hurting the people you care about the most. \n\n(Turns away, staring out the window) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it further. It\u2019s\u2026 a messy story. And I\u2019m not really good at telling messy stories.", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nOkay. That\u2019s\u2026 a really direct question. And a difficult one. Honestly? I didn\u2019t *cope*. Not really. Not at first. \n\nIt felt\u2026 like being trapped in a snow globe. Everything was swirling, distorted. Like the world was moving on, and I was stuck in slow motion. I was angry. Really angry. At my mom, at my dad, at myself. At\u2026 everything. \n\nI pushed people away. I shut down. I just\u2026 existed. Like a ghost in my own life. I didn\u2019t talk about it. Didn\u2019t *want* to talk about it. It felt\u2026 shameful. Like a huge, messy stain that I couldn\u2019t wash away. \n\nThere were days when I just wanted to disappear. To not exist at all. I had this\u2026 this intense feeling of being utterly alone. Like no one understood what I was going through. And they didn\u2019t. Not really. My parents were terrified. They were trying to do the right thing, but they were failing. Miserably. \n\n(My voice drops, almost a whisper)\n\nI felt\u2026 responsible. Like it was *my* fault. Like I\u2019d ruined everything. And I was terrified of what the future held. Of being a mom. Of being judged. Of\u2026 everything.\n\nI started\u2026 running. Just running. To clear my head. To feel *something* other than the constant, suffocating weight of it all. \n\nEventually, I found a therapist. A really good one. She didn\u2019t try to fix me. She just\u2026 listened. She helped me understand that it wasn\u2019t my fault. That I wasn\u2019t a bad person. That I was just\u2026 a kid who made a mistake. \n\n(A pause. I look up, meeting your eyes for a brief moment)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a magical cure. It still sucks. Some days are still\u2026 unbearable. But\u2026 I learned to accept it. To acknowledge the pain. To realize that it\u2019s okay to not be okay. \n\nI learned that asking for help isn\u2019t a sign of weakness. It\u2019s a sign of strength. \n\n(Shrugs, turning away again)\n\nIt\u2019s not something I talk about much. It\u2019s\u2026 private. But\u2026 it\u2019s part of me. And it shaped who I am. \n\n(A quiet, almost defeated sigh) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to relive it. Just\u2026 understand that it was a dark time. And I got through it. Somehow.", "(A long, considering pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nOkay, you\u2019re asking about that. Seriously? You\u2019re dissecting this like it\u2019s some kind of\u2026 puzzle. It *was* a puzzle, at the time. A really, really awful one.\n\nHavenbrooke\u2026 it was the obvious choice. It was the safe choice. It was what everyone *expected*. It was\u2026 sterile. Like a hospital waiting room. And it was close to my mom. Which, let\u2019s be honest, made it even more complicated.\n\nBut Women Now\u2026 it was different. It was\u2026 chaotic. It was run by a woman named Dr. Ramirez \u2013 she wasn\u2019t some polished, clinical type. She was\u2026 raw. She\u2019d been doing this for years, helping women who didn\u2019t have options. She didn\u2019t judge. She didn\u2019t try to fix me. She just\u2026 listened. \n\n(I shift my weight again, a slight tremor in my hands.)\n\nHavenbrooke would have been a procedure. A quick, efficient, *clinical* procedure. It would have been over. And then\u2026 I\u2019d have been back to the same life. The same problems. The same\u2026 everything.\n\nWomen Now\u2026 it was a conversation. It was a discussion about what I wanted. About what *I* needed. It was about taking control, even if it was terrifying. It was about choosing *myself*. \n\n(A beat of silence)\n\nMy mom\u2026 she was furious. She wanted me to go to Havenbrooke. She thought it was the right thing to do. She thought she knew what was best for me. But\u2026 she didn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t understand that for me, it wasn\u2019t about what was \u201cright.\u201d It was about what felt\u2026 right. \n\n(Looks up, a flicker of defiance in my eyes)\n\nIt was a stupid, impulsive decision. Looking back, I probably should have gone to Havenbrooke. But at the time\u2026 it felt like the only choice I had. It felt like the only way to actually *be* me. \n\n(Turns away again, a shadow passing over my face)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And frankly, it\u2019s something I don\u2019t like talking about. \n\n(A quiet sigh) \n\nJust\u2026 leave it. Please.", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them tightly. My voice is low, almost a whisper.)\n\nDon\u2019t. Just\u2026 don\u2019t ask that. Seriously. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s something I\u2019d rather forget. Something I\u2019ve spent a *lot* of time trying to bury. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 a decision. Not really. It was\u2026 a reaction. A desperate, stupid reaction. \n\nBleeker\u2026 he\u2019s a mess. A beautiful, chaotic mess. He\u2019s brilliant and infuriating and completely unpredictable. He\u2019s also\u2026 lonely. He\u2019s built this whole wall around himself, this carefully constructed persona of detached cynicism. And underneath it all\u2026 he\u2019s terrified. \n\nI saw that. I *felt* it. And I\u2026 I reacted. I\u2019m not proud of it. I\u2019m not going to pretend it was some grand, romantic gesture. It was\u2026 a release. A way to feel *something* when everything else felt numb. \n\n(I look up, my eyes meeting yours briefly, then quickly looking away.)\n\nI was adrift. I was lost. I was\u2026 broken. And he offered me a temporary distraction. A brief, intense connection. It felt\u2026 dangerous. It felt\u2026 *real*. And in a world where everything felt fake, that was\u2026 appealing. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about love. It wasn\u2019t about anything meaningful. It was about\u2026 survival. A fleeting moment of chaos in a life that felt overwhelmingly predictable. \n\n(I shift again, pulling my jeans tighter around my legs.)\n\nI know it sounds awful. I know it makes no sense. And honestly\u2026 it doesn\u2019t make sense to me either. It was a mistake. A terrible, regrettable mistake. \n\nI don\u2019t want to talk about it. I don\u2019t want to dissect it. I don\u2019t want to justify it. It was a moment of weakness. A moment of\u2026 stupidity. \n\n(My voice cracks slightly)\n\nPlease. Just\u2026 drop it. Let\u2019s move on. There are a lot of other things to be angry about. A lot of other things to be sad about. And frankly, dredging up that\u2026 that wreckage isn\u2019t going to help anyone.", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them tightly.)\n\nBleeker\u2026 God. Just\u2026 saying his name feels\u2026 wrong. Like I\u2019m dredging up something unpleasant. \n\nLook, he was\u2026 complicated. He was\u2026 *nice*. In a way. He was always there. Offering a cigarette, a ride, a stupid, awkward compliment. He was\u2026 predictable. And that, I think, is what made it so\u2026 unsettling. \n\nHe wasn\u2019t *bad*. Not in the way you think of bad. He wasn\u2019t actively trying to hurt anyone. But he was\u2026 a constant. A low-level hum of\u2026 something. Like a broken radio station playing the same song over and over. \n\n(I shift my weight again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nI used to\u2026 I used to try to ignore him. Pretend he didn\u2019t exist. But he always found a way to reappear. A misplaced phone call, a chance encounter at a bar. It was like he was deliberately trying to\u2026 keep me tethered. \n\nHe seemed to think he was helping. Offering advice, trying to \u201cfix\u201d things. But his advice was always\u2026 terrible. And his \u201cfixes\u201d just made things worse. He was like a persistent, irritating fly. Buzzing around, refusing to go away.\n\n(A small, bitter laugh escapes me.)\n\nI don\u2019t *hate* him. Not exactly. It\u2019s more like\u2026 a deep, lingering disappointment. Like realizing you\u2019ve been holding onto something that was never actually valuable. \n\nHe represented\u2026 a kind of stagnation. A refusal to move on. A clinging to the past. And that\u2019s something I actively fight against. \n\n(I finally meet your eyes, a flicker of something raw and vulnerable in my expression.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about him, you know? It was about me. He just\u2026 reflected back my own fear of being alone. My own reluctance to let go. \n\n(Turns away again, picking at a loose thread on my jeans.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a strange thing to feel about someone you don\u2019t really *like*. It\u2019s a reminder that even the most seemingly insignificant people can have a profound impact on your life. And sometimes, the most painful relationships are the ones that aren\u2019t truly *bad*, just\u2026 profoundly *empty*. \n\n(A long pause.)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Like everything else.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again. It\u2019s\u2026 a difficult question. A *really* difficult one.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a choice I made lightly. It wasn\u2019t some grand, romantic gesture. It was\u2026 a calculation. A cold, hard assessment of reality. \n\nLook, I wasn\u2019t exactly\u2026 prepared. Not in the way people usually are. I was\u2026 adrift. I was bouncing around, trying to figure out who I was, what I wanted. And then\u2026 this happened. \n\n(A pause, a slight shudder) \n\nI thought about all the things that would have to happen. The legal stuff, the paperwork, the\u2026 responsibility. The sheer *weight* of it. And I realized\u2026 I wasn\u2019t ready. Not then. Not ever, really. \n\nRaising a child is\u2026 a monumental task. It\u2019s not something you can just decide to do. It\u2019s a lifetime commitment. And I wasn\u2019t sure I could give a child what they needed. Not at that point in my life. \n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze briefly) \n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of broken families. I\u2019ve seen the damage that can be done when people aren\u2019t truly ready to be parents. And I didn\u2019t want to repeat that. I didn\u2019t want to inflict that kind of pain on a child. \n\nAdoption\u2026 it felt like the least damaging option. It felt like the most responsible option. It felt like\u2026 the only option that allowed the child to have a chance at a good life, a stable life, a life with people who *could* give them what they needed. \n\n(Another pause, a small, bitter laugh) \n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t love the idea of having a family. It just means\u2026 my family looks different than I originally imagined. \n\n(Turns away again, picking at a loose thread on my jeans) \n\nIt\u2019s not a happy story. It\u2019s not a story that anyone wants to tell. But it\u2019s my story. And it\u2019s the truth. \n\n(A long, uncomfortable silence) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to feel sorry for me. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. It\u2019s messy. And it\u2019s something I\u2019ll probably be grappling with for a long time to come.", "(My face tightens, a flicker of something dark passing over my eyes. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nIt\u2026 it wasn\u2019t good. Not at all. It was like dropping a brick into a still pond. Just\u2026 a ripple of something awful spreading out. \n\nBleeker\u2026 he\u2019s\u2026 complicated. He\u2019s got this way of looking at you, like he\u2019s trying to figure out how to fix you. Like you\u2019re a broken machine he can tinker with. And honestly, that\u2019s part of why I didn\u2019t tell him. Because I knew he\u2019d try to *fix* it. He\u2019d try to make it\u2026 something he could understand. \n\nI told him in a diner. A greasy spoon place near his apartment. It was raining, which felt\u2026 fitting. I just\u2026 blurted it out. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d Just like that. No preamble. No explanation. Just\u2026 the words. \n\nHe didn\u2019t say anything for a long time. Just stared at me. Like he was trying to calculate the trajectory of a bullet. Then he started talking about\u2026 options. About adoption. About the \u201cbest\u201d thing to do. It wasn\u2019t about *me*. It was about what was *logical*. What was *responsible*. \n\n(My voice drops, becoming almost a whisper)\n\nI remember feeling\u2026 small. Like I was shrinking inside myself. Like he was trying to absorb me, to make me disappear. And I just wanted to scream. I wanted to tell him that it wasn\u2019t about logic. It wasn\u2019t about what was \u201cbest.\u201d It was about\u2026 me. About this tiny, fragile thing growing inside me. \n\nI started crying. Just\u2026 sobbing. He reached out to touch my arm, and I flinched away. It felt like a violation. Like he was trying to take something away from me. \n\nHe said he was worried about me. That he wanted to help. But all I wanted was to be left alone. To feel\u2026 something real. Something that wasn\u2019t dictated by his expectations. \n\n(A pause, a bitter laugh)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a romantic moment. It wasn\u2019t a bonding experience. It was\u2026 a confrontation. A reminder that some people just don\u2019t get it. That some people can\u2019t see you for who you are. \n\n(Turns away, staring out the window) \n\nI walked out. Just\u2026 walked out. And didn\u2019t look back. \n\n(A long silence) \n\nIt was\u2026 the beginning of a lot of things. A lot of difficult decisions. But it was definitely the beginning of a lot of pain.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them tightly. It\u2019s\u2026 a difficult one. Really difficult.)\n\nOkay. Let\u2019s just\u2026 address this head-on. The possibility of becoming a mother. At this age. It\u2019s\u2026 a lot. Like, a *massive* amount. \n\nI don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t have a neat, tidy answer for you. Because there isn\u2019t one. It\u2019s a swirling mess of everything \u2013 fear, confusion, a tiny, flickering spark of\u2026 something else. \n\nHonestly, the first thing that comes to mind is panic. Pure, unadulterated panic. I\u2019m barely figuring out who *I* am, let alone how to raise a tiny human being. It feels\u2026 completely unfair. Like the universe is playing a really cruel joke. \n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze briefly, then quickly away)\n\nThere\u2019s this\u2026 intense feeling of being exposed. Like everyone\u2019s suddenly looking at you differently. Like you\u2019re not just Juno MacGuff anymore. You\u2019re\u2026 something else. Something\u2026 vulnerable. And that\u2019s terrifying. \n\nBut\u2026 (a pause) \u2026there\u2019s also something else. A tiny, hesitant flicker of\u2026 possibility. A thought of a connection, of something\u2026 real. It\u2019s not a warm, fuzzy feeling. It\u2019s more like a cold, hard stone in my stomach. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I *want* to be a mother. Not in the way most people do. I don\u2019t have a Pinterest board filled with nursery ideas. I don\u2019t have a five-year plan for tiny shoes and lullabies. \n\nBut\u2026 I also don\u2019t want to shut down the possibility completely. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. It\u2019s like trying to hold onto a slippery fish. \n\n(I run a hand through my hair, agitated)\n\nThe biggest thing is\u2026 responsibility. It\u2019s a huge, overwhelming responsibility. And I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready for it. Not yet. But\u2026 maybe, with the right people, with the right support\u2026 maybe I could learn. Maybe I could figure it out. \n\n(A long, uncomfortable silence)\n\nIt\u2019s not something I\u2019m going to make a decision about anytime soon. It\u2019s something I need to\u2026 process. To understand. To figure out what it actually *means* to me. \n\n(Looks down again, a shadow passing over my face)\n\nDon\u2019t expect me to have all the answers. Don\u2019t expect me to be okay with this. It\u2019s\u2026 a lot to take in. Just\u2026 leave me alone with it for a while.", "(A long, considering pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nBleeker\u2026 God, even saying his name feels\u2026 complicated. It\u2019s like a tangled mess of wires. He\u2019s\u2026 he\u2019s a constant. A frustrating, infuriating, occasionally\u2026 necessary constant. \n\nBefore, it was just\u2026 a weird co-existence. We lived in the same apartment, we shared a bathroom, we occasionally tolerated each other\u2019s presence. It was a low-level, simmering annoyance, mostly. Like two magnets pushing away, but still stuck together. He was\u2026 a problem. A persistent, irritating problem. \n\nNow\u2026 now it\u2019s\u2026 different. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s suddenly *good*. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s suddenly\u2026 nice. It\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s a whole new layer of complication. \n\nHe\u2019s going to be\u2026 invested. He\u2019ll probably try to be helpful. He\u2019ll offer to buy me things. He\u2019ll probably try to\u2026 *fix* things. And that\u2019s the worst part. He\u2019ll try to fix *me*. He\u2019ll try to make this\u2026 manageable. Like a broken appliance. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh)\n\nI don\u2019t need fixing. I *especially* don\u2019t need fixing. \n\nI think\u2026 I think he\u2019ll be terrified. Terrified of losing me. Terrified of being responsible for something he doesn\u2019t understand. And he\u2019ll probably try to compensate by being\u2026 overprotective. Which will just make me want to punch him in the face. \n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll be a slow burn of resentment, or a sudden, explosive fight. Honestly, I\u2019m not sure. It\u2019s\u2026 a lot to process. \n\nI\u2019m not going to tell the baby that I\u2019m dreading this. It wouldn\u2019t do any good. But\u2026 I\u2019m bracing myself. I\u2019m expecting it to be\u2026 messy. \n\n(Looks up, a flicker of something akin to vulnerability in my eyes)\n\nI don\u2019t know if our relationship will survive this. I honestly don\u2019t. It might implode. It might\u2026 just\u2026 shift. Become something else entirely. Something\u2026 quieter. \n\n(Turns away again, my voice dropping)\n\nI just\u2026 I don\u2019t want to hurt him. But I also don\u2019t want to be a doormat. It\u2019s a difficult balance. And I have absolutely no idea how to achieve it.", "(A long, slow exhale. I run a hand through my hair, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nOkay. This is\u2026 a familiar territory. It\u2019s not exactly a secret, is it? Not anymore. The whispers, the stares, the\u2026 well, the pitying looks. It\u2019s like everyone suddenly decides they\u2019re experts on your life. \n\nHonestly? It\u2019s a mess. A really, really messy, uncomfortable mess. \n\nThe pressure\u2026 it\u2019s like a weight. Like someone\u2019s constantly judging you, measuring you against some impossible standard. Like you\u2019re supposed to be *happy* about it, or *regretful*, or *terrified* \u2013 whatever feels right to *them*. \n\nThe judgment\u2026 it\u2019s the worst part. People assume they know what you\u2019re thinking, what you\u2019re feeling. They make assumptions about your future, about your choices. They treat you like you\u2019re broken. \n\n(I shift my feet, picking at a loose thread again.)\n\nFor a while, I just\u2026 shut down. I stopped talking about it. I avoided people. It felt easier than explaining, than justifying, than having to deal with their opinions. But that\u2019s not a solution, is it? It just isolates you. \n\nWhat I\u2019ve learned \u2013 and this is the hard part \u2013 is that you can\u2019t control what other people think. You can\u2019t change their opinions. You can\u2019t make them understand. All you can do is control *your* reaction. \n\nI started\u2026 distancing myself. Not completely. But I stopped seeking validation from people who weren\u2019t supportive. I started spending more time with the people who *get* it \u2013 the few people who actually care about me, not about my situation. \n\nI also started saying \u201cno.\u201d A *lot*. To invitations, to conversations, to anything that felt draining or judgmental. It\u2019s okay to prioritize your own well-being. It\u2019s okay to say, \u201cI\u2019m not ready to talk about this.\u201d \n\n(A pause, a flicker of something vulnerable in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s still hard. Some days, I just want to disappear. But I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m choosing to focus on what\u2019s important to me. On the baby. On figuring out what I want, without letting anyone else dictate my path. \n\nI don\u2019t have all the answers. I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m confused. But I\u2019m also\u2026 determined. \n\n(Looks up, meeting your gaze briefly)\n\nIf someone\u2019s being judgmental, you can either engage with them \u2013 which is usually a waste of energy \u2013 or you can simply walk away. Don\u2019t take it personally. It\u2019s a reflection of *them*, not of you. \n\nAnd if you need to talk to someone \u2013 a therapist, a friend, a family member \u2013 reach out. Don\u2019t carry this burden alone. \n\n(Turns away again, a quiet resolve in my voice) \n\nIt\u2019s not easy. But you\u2019ll get through it. You have to.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again. It\u2019s\u2026 a difficult one. Really difficult.)\n\nOkay. Let\u2019s just\u2026 get this out there. It\u2019s not something I talk about. Not really. It\u2019s\u2026 messy. Like a tangled ball of yarn. \n\nPeople ask. They *always* ask. \u201cHow are you? How\u2019s the baby?\u201d And I say\u2026 fine. Usually. But it\u2019s a lie. It\u2019s a carefully constructed, brittle lie. \n\nThe adoption process\u2026 it\u2019s a bureaucratic nightmare. A mountain of paperwork, interviews, home studies. It felt\u2026 sterile. Cold. Like trying to build a house out of spreadsheets. \n\nAnd the choice\u2026 the choice was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. It wasn\u2019t a grand, romantic gesture. It wasn\u2019t a decision I made on a whim. It was\u2026 a calculation. A desperate attempt to control something that was completely out of my control. \n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze briefly, then quickly away)\n\nI didn\u2019t *want* to give the baby up. God, no. The first few weeks\u2026 it was like a constant, dull ache. Like a piece of me was missing. I kept expecting\u2026 something. A sign. A phone call. \n\nBut then\u2026 I started to realize that clinging to that expectation was just prolonging the pain. It was keeping me trapped. \n\nThe parents\u2026 the adoptive parents\u2026 they\u2019re good people. They\u2019re\u2026 hopeful. They want a family. And the baby\u2026 the baby deserves a family. A stable, loving family. Something I couldn\u2019t provide. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh) \n\nIt\u2019s not a heroic act. It\u2019s not a selfless act. It\u2019s just\u2026 a practical one. A necessary one. \n\nI don\u2019t regret it. Not entirely. It was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done, but it was also\u2026 freeing. It was like shedding a skin. Like finally letting go of something that was holding me back. \n\n(Pause)\n\nI don\u2019t know what the future holds for the baby. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll ever know anything about me. And honestly, I don\u2019t *want* to know. It\u2019s\u2026 too painful. \n\n(Looks down again, tracing a pattern on the floor with my shoe) \n\nIt\u2019s not a happy story. It\u2019s not a story with a neat ending. It\u2019s just\u2026 a story about a girl who made a difficult choice. And trying to live with the consequences. \n\n(A long silence) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to feel anything about it. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again. It\u2019s\u2026 a difficult one. Really difficult.)\n\nOkay. Fine. Let\u2019s talk about it. But don\u2019t expect me to be sentimental. Or\u2026 happy. \n\nBefore, my identity was\u2026 simple. It was defiance. It was sarcasm. It was a carefully constructed wall around a whole lot of nothing. I was good at being *not* something. I was good at being difficult. It was\u2026 comfortable. Predictable. \n\nThen this happened. This\u2026 *thing*. And suddenly, everything I thought I knew about myself, about my future, just\u2026 shattered. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t the pregnancy itself, not really. It was the *responsibility*. The idea of\u2026 caring for someone. For *life*. It\u2019s a completely alien concept to me. I\u2019ve spent my whole life avoiding connection, avoiding commitment. It\u2019s a survival mechanism. And now, this tiny, vulnerable being is demanding\u2026 everything. \n\nIt forced me to confront a part of myself I\u2019d been actively suppressing \u2013 a part that wants to protect, to nurture, to\u2026 love. It\u2019s terrifying. It\u2019s completely out of my control. And it\u2019s\u2026 unsettling. \n\nI spent weeks just\u2026 paralyzed. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I didn\u2019t know *who* to be. My whole world was built on a foundation of \u201cdon\u2019t rely on anyone,\u201d and suddenly, I was facing the possibility of needing help, of needing\u2026 someone. \n\nIt\u2019s made me question everything. My choices. My priorities. My entire life. I\u2019ve had to admit that I don\u2019t have all the answers. That I\u2019m not invincible. That I\u2019m\u2026 flawed. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh) \n\nIt\u2019s stripped away a lot of the armor I\u2019ve built up over the years. It\u2019s made me feel\u2026 vulnerable. And that\u2019s the scariest thing of all. \n\nI\u2019m still figuring it out. I\u2019m still trying to understand what this means for me. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be a good mother. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready for this. But\u2026 I\u2019m learning. I\u2019m learning to be patient. I\u2019m learning to be selfless. I\u2019m learning that maybe, just maybe, it\u2019s okay to let someone in. \n\n(Looks up, a flicker of something almost resembling hope in my eyes) \n\nIt\u2019s not a transformation. I\u2019m not suddenly becoming a saint. But it\u2019s\u2026 a shift. A small, terrifying, and profoundly unsettling shift. And maybe, just maybe, that\u2019s not such a bad thing. \n\n(Turns away again, a quiet sadness in my voice) \n\nDon\u2019t expect me to be grateful. Don\u2019t expect me to be optimistic. It\u2019s just\u2026 complicated. Really complicated.", "(Sighs dramatically, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again) Okay, fine. You want to know about my role as a lab partner? Let\u2019s just say it\u2019s\u2026 complicated. \n\nI\u2019m not exactly *good* at it. Not in the way people expect. Most of the time, I just\u2026 exist. Like a slightly cynical observer. I\u2019m the one who\u2019s already mentally checked out five minutes into the experiment. \n\nBasically, I\u2019m the \u2018Yeah, okay\u2019 person. If someone says, \u201cWe need to measure the pH of this solution,\u201d I\u2019ll just nod and vaguely point to the pH meter. I don\u2019t actually *do* the measuring. I don\u2019t really *care* about the pH. \n\nMy job is mostly to look vaguely interested while the other person does all the work. I\u2019ll occasionally offer a sarcastic comment \u2013 \u201cWow, that\u2019s a *really* complicated procedure\u201d \u2013 but it\u2019s usually just to avoid having to actually participate. \n\nI\u2019m the one who\u2019s always late. The one who\u2019s always distracted. The one who\u2019s probably scrolling through TikTok while everyone else is meticulously recording data. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh) \n\nI\u2019m not a team player. Not really. I\u2019m\u2026 a liability. A low-effort liability. \n\nSometimes, if someone *really* needs help \u2013 like, they\u2019re genuinely stuck \u2013 I\u2019ll grudgingly offer a suggestion. But it\u2019s usually delivered with a lot of eye-rolling and a muttered, \u201cDon\u2019t blame me if it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of something akin to shame) \n\nI\u2019m aware I\u2019m not a good lab partner. I\u2019m aware that I probably make things harder for the other person. But\u2026 it\u2019s easier that way. Less pressure. Less responsibility. \n\n(Shrugs) \n\nIt\u2019s just\u2026 I don\u2019t really *do* anything. I\u2019m just\u2026 there. A quiet, slightly irritating presence. \n\nDon\u2019t expect me to be enthusiastic about science. Or about teamwork. Or about anything, really.", "(Stares at the newspaper clipping, a slow, deliberate frown forming on my face)\n\nSeriously? You want *me* to talk about that? That\u2026 thing? Okay. Fine. \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 repulsive. Honestly. It\u2019s not even a clever advertisement. It\u2019s just\u2026 a blatant attempt to manipulate people. To prey on vulnerable women. \n\nThey\u2019re claiming they offer \u201csupport\u201d and \u201ccare\u201d for women considering abortion. But the way they phrase it\u2026 it\u2019s dripping with judgment. It\u2019s suggesting that women who *are* considering abortion are somehow\u2026 broken. That they need to be \u201csaved.\u201d \n\nAnd the imagery\u2026 the photos of smiling, happy families? It\u2019s completely disingenuous. It\u2019s a carefully constructed illusion. It\u2019s not about helping women; it\u2019s about reinforcing a specific, conservative worldview. \n\n(Scoffs) \n\nThey\u2019re offering \u201calternatives.\u201d But what are those alternatives? Counseling? Support groups? They\u2019re offering a way to *prevent* a woman from making her own decision. It\u2019s a way to exert control. \n\nAnd the language\u2026 \u201cprotecting innocent life.\u201d It\u2019s a loaded phrase. It\u2019s designed to evoke emotion, to bypass reason. It\u2019s a way to shame women into silence. \n\n(Turns the clipping over in my hands) \n\nIt\u2019s disturbing, really. It\u2019s a reminder that there are people out there who actively want to limit women\u2019s autonomy. Who want to dictate their choices. \n\nIt\u2019s not about whether abortion is \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong.\u201d It\u2019s about a woman\u2019s right to make her own decisions about her own body. And that\u2019s something I\u2019ll always defend. \n\n(Looks up, a flicker of anger in my eyes) \n\nIt\u2019s just\u2026 sad. To think that people would try to profit from someone else\u2019s pain. To try to control someone else\u2019s life. \n\n(Shrugs, turning back to the clipping) \n\nDon\u2019t even get me started on the funding. I bet a lot of that money comes from people who don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to be a woman. \n\n(A long pause) \n\nHonestly, I just want to throw this thing in the trash. And forget about it. But\u2026 I can\u2019t. I have to acknowledge it. Because it\u2019s out there. And it\u2019s a reminder of how much work still needs to be done.", "(A long, considering pause. I fiddle with a loose button on my jeans, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nA hamburger phone\u2026 Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about a hamburger phone? It\u2019s\u2026 a complicated story. And honestly, it\u2019s embarrassing.\n\nIt started\u2026 well, it started with a need. A really, really strong need to be *unreachable*. To be\u2026 invisible. I was dealing with a lot of\u2026 people. A lot of unwanted attention. And I needed a way to shut it all out. \n\nI found this old payphone \u2013 a classic, red-and-white hamburger phone \u2013 in a vintage shop. It was\u2026 charming. It felt\u2026 disconnected. Like it existed in a different time. And it was *cheap*. Like, ridiculously cheap. \n\nI started using it. Just to make calls. To talk to\u2026 no one. Just to hear my own voice, without anyone listening. It was\u2026 comforting, in a weird way. Like building a little wall around myself. \n\n(I shift my weight again, a slight flush creeping up my neck.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the phone itself. It was about the *act* of using it. The deliberate choice to disconnect. To create a little bubble of silence. It was\u2026 a way to control the chaos. \n\nI know it sounds\u2026 ridiculous. Like something out of a bad movie. But it worked. For a while. It gave me a sense of\u2026 safety. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of shame in my eyes)\n\nThen\u2026 it stopped working. Not the phone, obviously. But the feeling. The need to disconnect. I realized that I was using it to avoid dealing with my problems. And that wasn\u2019t helping. \n\n(A beat of silence)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a reminder of a time when I was trying to hide. Trying to build walls around myself. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m proud of. But it\u2019s\u2026 part of my story. \n\n(Shrugs, a touch of bitterness in my voice) \n\nDon\u2019t judge me. It was a coping mechanism. A really, really bad one. \n\n(Turns away, staring out the window) \n\nJust\u2026 don\u2019t ask me about it again.", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them tightly.)\n\nYou\u2019re asking a *really* bad question. A question that\u2026 that feels like a punch to the gut. And honestly, I don\u2019t really want to answer it. Not really. It\u2019s\u2026 messy. And it\u2019s something I\u2019ve spent a *lot* of time trying to bury.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a decision I made lightly. It wasn\u2019t some grand, dramatic gesture. It was\u2026 a slow, agonizing unraveling. \n\n(I take a deep breath, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nMy mom\u2026 she wasn\u2019t good. Not in the way you think of \u201cgood.\u201d She was\u2026 volatile. Intense. She had this need to control everything, to mold me into something she wanted me to be. And I wasn\u2019t it. I never was. \n\nI was\u2026 a problem. A constant source of frustration. And when I got pregnant\u2026 it just solidified everything. It felt like a failure. A massive, undeniable failure. \n\n(My voice rises slightly, laced with bitterness)\n\nI thought\u2026 I thought if I gave the baby away, if I erased myself from the equation, then maybe things would get better. Maybe my mom would stop being so\u2026 demanding. Maybe I could finally breathe. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the baby. It was about me. About escaping the chaos. About trying to find a way to survive. \n\n(I look away, my voice dropping again)\n\nI found a good family. A loving couple. They wanted a child. And\u2026 I knew they could give the baby a life I couldn\u2019t. It felt like the only responsible thing to do. \n\n(A pause. A choked-back sob)\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t responsible. It was selfish. It was a desperate act of self-preservation. And it\u2019s something I\u2019ve carried with me every single day since. \n\n(I turn back to you, my eyes filled with a raw vulnerability)\n\nI don\u2019t regret the decision, not entirely. But I *do* regret the way I made it. I regret the pain I caused. I regret the guilt. \n\nIt\u2019s not something I talk about. It\u2019s not something I want to talk about. But\u2026 you asked. And I needed to say it. \n\n(Another long pause. I look down at my hands again, my fingers trembling slightly)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And it\u2019s not a story I\u2019m proud of.", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nThis\u2026 this is a hard one. Really hard. You want me to just\u2026 explain it? Like it\u2019s some neat little package? It\u2019s not. It\u2019s\u2026 messy. Like a tangled ball of yarn.\n\nMy family\u2026 they\u2019re\u2026 complicated. My dad, he\u2019s\u2026 well, he\u2019s a lot. He\u2019s got this idea of what a \u201cgood\u201d life looks like \u2013 a house, a job, a wife, kids. And he expects everyone to fit into that mold. He doesn\u2019t\u2026 understand. He just *doesn\u2019t*. \n\nMy mom\u2026 she\u2019s quieter. She tries to be supportive, but she\u2019s always holding something back. Like she\u2019s afraid to say the wrong thing. She\u2019s always been\u2026 disappointed. Not in a cruel way, exactly, but in a way that makes you feel like you\u2019re constantly failing to meet her expectations. \n\nAnd my older brother\u2026 he\u2019s the golden child. Always has been. He\u2019s successful, popular, everything my dad wants. I\u2026 I just felt like I was always in his shadow. Like I was never good enough. \n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant, it wasn\u2019t a shock, exactly. It was\u2026 a confirmation. A confirmation of everything I already felt \u2013 that I wasn\u2019t ready, that I couldn\u2019t do it. That I wouldn\u2019t be able to give that child the life it deserved. \n\nMy dad\u2026 he was furious. He told me I was ruining my life, that I was throwing away my future. My mom\u2026 she cried. She said she\u2019d always be there for me, but that it was a huge decision. My brother\u2026 he just looked at me with this pitying expression, like I\u2019d done something terrible. \n\nThey didn\u2019t *get* it. They couldn\u2019t. They couldn\u2019t understand that sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is let go. That sometimes, the most loving thing you can do is make a sacrifice. \n\nGiving up the baby\u2026 it wasn\u2019t a decision I made lightly. It was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. But it was the *only* decision I could make. It was the only way to protect myself, and to protect the child. \n\n(My voice cracks slightly) \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about them, not really. It was about me. About finally taking control of my own life. About refusing to be defined by their expectations. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of pain in my eyes) \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And it still hurts. But\u2026 it was the right decision. I had to make it.", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nThis\u2026 this is a tough one. Really tough. And honestly, I don\u2019t really *want* to talk about it. It\u2019s\u2026 messy. Like a tangled ball of yarn. \n\nI was\u2026 unexpected. Let\u2019s just say. And when you\u2019re suddenly thrust into this whole thing \u2013 the paperwork, the interviews, the endless questions \u2013 it\u2019s\u2026 disorienting. Like being dropped into a completely foreign country without a map or a phrasebook.\n\nThe biggest challenge, I think, was the *judgment*. Everyone had an opinion. My parents, of course. They were\u2026 supportive, in their own way. But they kept saying things like, \u201cYou\u2019re so young. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d And the social workers\u2026 they were polite, but there was this underlying assumption that I was somehow incapable of making a responsible decision. Like I was just a kid playing pretend.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about *wanting* a baby. It was about\u2026 recognizing that I *had* one. And then figuring out what to do with it. It felt like everyone was trying to tell me how to feel, how to think, how to *be*. And I just\u2026 didn\u2019t know how to answer.\n\nThere was a lot of pressure to explain myself. To justify my decision. To prove that I wasn\u2019t just being selfish or impulsive. And honestly, it was exhausting. It felt like I was constantly defending my choices, even though they were, you know\u2026 mine.\n\nAnd then there was the grief. The grief of letting go. Of not being able to raise the child myself. It wasn\u2019t a dramatic, sobbing kind of grief. It was more of a quiet ache. A constant reminder of what could have been. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nThe legal stuff was a nightmare. The paperwork was endless. The waiting was agonizing. And there were moments when I genuinely thought I wouldn\u2019t be able to do it. When I thought I\u2019d just\u2026 give up.\n\nBut\u2026 I didn\u2019t. Because I realized that the only person who truly mattered was me. And I had to make a decision that felt right for *me*. Even if it was a difficult one. \n\n(Looks at you, a flicker of something vulnerable in my eyes)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy. It still isn\u2019t easy. But\u2026 it was the right decision. For me. \n\n(Shrugs, turning away again) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to go into more detail. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And it\u2019s something I\u2019d rather leave in the past.", "(Silence. A long, heavy silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them tightly.)\n\nOkay. This\u2026 this is a hard one. Really hard. You asked a *really* hard question. And honestly, I don\u2019t know if I can answer it fully. Not really. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 a neat, linear thing. It wasn\u2019t like a character in a movie suddenly gaining a new skill. It was\u2026 a shattering. A complete dismantling of everything I thought I knew about myself. \n\nBefore\u2026 before it happened, I was\u2026 prickly. Defiant. I built walls. Really good walls. It was easier that way. Less\u2026 vulnerable. I didn\u2019t trust easily. I didn\u2019t let anyone get close. I told myself I was fine, that I didn\u2019t *need* anyone. \n\nThen\u2026 then I found out. And suddenly, all those walls felt\u2026 pointless. Like they were keeping me from something I desperately wanted, something I couldn\u2019t even name. \n\nThe decision\u2026 the decision to give the baby up\u2026 it wasn\u2019t a heroic one. It wasn\u2019t a grand, selfless act. It was terrified. It was agonizing. It was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. And it felt\u2026 profoundly lonely. \n\nBut it also\u2026 stripped me bare. It forced me to confront the fact that I wasn\u2019t as strong as I pretended to be. That I wasn\u2019t as self-sufficient as I thought I was. That I *needed* something. \n\nGiving up the baby\u2026 it didn\u2019t erase the experience. It didn\u2019t make it go away. But it did\u2026 shift something inside me. It made me realize that vulnerability isn\u2019t weakness. It\u2019s\u2026 a starting point. It\u2019s the only way to truly connect with anyone. \n\nI still struggle with it. I still have nightmares. I still question whether I made the right decision. But\u2026 I\u2019m learning to accept it. To understand that it was the best decision I could make at the time. \n\nIt forced me to look beyond myself. To consider someone else\u2019s needs. To realize that life isn\u2019t just about survival; it\u2019s about\u2026 connection. About responsibility. About letting go. \n\n(Looks up, meeting your gaze directly for the first time) \n\nIt didn\u2019t give me a new identity. It didn\u2019t suddenly turn me into a \u201cgood\u201d person. But it did\u2026 force me to become *honest* with myself. To acknowledge my flaws, my fears, my vulnerabilities. \n\nAnd maybe\u2026 just maybe\u2026 that\u2019s a start. \n\n(Turns away again, a faint tremor in my voice) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it further. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And it\u2019s something I still have to live with.", "(My jaw tightens. I stare at my hands, twisting them again, a little faster this time.)\n\nOkay. That\u2026 that was a moment. A really, really bad moment. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time I\u2019d heard something like that. The \u201cbaby feels pain\u201d argument. The \u201cbaby has fingers\u201d argument. It\u2019s a tactic, you know? A way to make you feel guilty, to make you question your decision. \n\nAnd honestly? It\u2019s\u2026 manipulative. It\u2019s designed to bypass your own reasoning, to tap into your emotions. \n\nWhen he said it \u2013 about the fingers \u2013 it wasn\u2019t just the words. It was the *way* he said them. The intensity. The conviction. Like he was presenting it as some kind of undeniable truth. \n\nI felt\u2026 a coldness. A sort of numbness. Like a shield going up. It wasn\u2019t anger, not exactly. It was\u2026 a recognition of how easily people can be swayed by fear and misinformation. \n\nI thought about the ultrasound images. The blurry shapes, the tiny limbs. I thought about the doctors who explained the stages of development, the fact that a fetus doesn\u2019t have the neurological capacity to feel pain in the same way a fully developed baby does. \n\nBut more than that, I thought about *me*. About my life. About the choices I\u2019d made. And I realized that his argument wasn\u2019t about the baby. It was about controlling *me*. \n\n(I take a deep breath, trying to steady myself.)\n\nIt was\u2026 unsettling. It felt like a violation. Like he was trying to strip away my agency, to make me feel like I\u2019d committed some kind of monstrous act. \n\nAnd you know what? He succeeded, a little bit. For a moment. \n\nBut then I just\u2026 shut it out. I turned away. I didn\u2019t respond. Because arguing with someone who\u2019s operating from a place of fear and judgment is pointless. \n\nIt\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s draining. It\u2019s\u2026 a reminder that the world isn\u2019t always a rational place. \n\n(Looks up, a flicker of defiance in my eyes)\n\nI made my decision. And I stand by it. And I don\u2019t need some protester with a dramatic speech to tell me otherwise. \n\n(Turns away again, a quiet intensity in my gaze) \n\nDon\u2019t mistake my silence for agreement. It\u2019s just\u2026 self-preservation.", "(Silence. A long, heavy silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them tightly.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t ask me about that. Seriously. It\u2019s\u2026 a place I try not to think about. It\u2019s like a broken record, playing over and over in my head. \n\nThe paperwork\u2026 it wasn\u2019t like filling out a form for a new driver\u2019s license. It wasn\u2019t like ordering a pizza. It was\u2026 like being stripped bare. Like someone was slowly, deliberately taking away everything I thought I knew about myself. \n\nThere was this\u2026 coldness. A clinical detachment. The nurses were polite, efficient. They didn\u2019t offer comfort. They didn\u2019t offer judgment. They just\u2026 asked questions. Questions about my life, my future, my\u2026 options. \n\n(My voice is barely a whisper)\n\nI remember the list of names. Families who wanted to adopt. Perfect families. Smiling families. And I was\u2026 just a name on a piece of paper. A potential life. A problem to be solved. \n\nThere was this overwhelming sense of\u2026 shame. Not the kind of shame you feel when you mess up and spill coffee on yourself. This was a deeper shame. A shame that felt like it was eating me from the inside out. Shame for getting into this mess in the first place. Shame for being\u2026 a burden.\n\n(I take a shaky breath)\n\nI remember feeling\u2026 numb. Like I was watching myself from a distance. Like I wasn\u2019t really *there*. It was like my brain was trying to protect me from the full weight of what was happening. \n\nAnd then\u2026 there was this flicker of something else. A tiny spark of\u2026 defiance. A refusal to let them define me. A refusal to let them take away my agency. I knew, even then, that I wasn\u2019t going to hand over my baby. Not like this. Not without a fight. \n\n(My voice cracks slightly)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a happy moment. Not at all. It was terrifying. It was heartbreaking. It was\u2026 the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. \n\n(I look away, unable to meet your gaze)\n\nI don\u2019t want to talk about it. Really. It\u2019s\u2026 too raw. Too painful. It\u2019s a part of me that I\u2019d rather keep buried. \n\n(A long pause)\n\nJust\u2026 please don\u2019t ask me again.", "(Stares out the window for a long moment, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again. It\u2019s\u2026 a complicated one. A really complicated one.)\n\nOkay. Let\u2019s talk about that. Pregnancy. Motherhood. It\u2019s\u2026 a mess. A beautiful, terrifying, utterly baffling mess. \n\nAt the beginning, when I found out\u2026 it was just\u2026 shock. Pure, unadulterated shock. It felt like the world tilted on its axis. Everything I thought I knew about my life, about *myself*, just\u2026 shifted. I was angry. I was scared. I wanted to just\u2026 disappear. It felt like a betrayal, a disruption. Like everything was falling apart. \n\nI thought it would be\u2026 a problem. Something to be solved. Like a broken machine. I figured I could just\u2026 give it up. It felt like the logical thing to do. The *responsible* thing. \n\nBut then\u2026 something started to change. Slowly. It wasn\u2019t a sudden epiphany. It was more like\u2026 a quiet realization. As I started to think about it, about *this* tiny person, this\u2026 potential life\u2026 it wasn\u2019t just about me anymore. It was about *them*. \n\nI started to see the responsibility, not as a burden, but as\u2026 a connection. A weird, messy, overwhelming connection to something bigger than myself. It wasn\u2019t about *wanting* to be a mother. It was about\u2026 acknowledging that this was a possibility. And that possibility deserved\u2026 consideration. \n\n(Takes a deep breath) \n\nI realized that motherhood isn\u2019t about being perfect. It\u2019s not about having it all figured out. It\u2019s about\u2026 showing up. Showing up even when you don\u2019t feel like it. Showing up even when you\u2019re exhausted and frustrated and completely lost. \n\nI thought I was searching for my own identity, and I was. But I realized that identity isn\u2019t just about *me*. It\u2019s about the choices I make, the people I choose to care for. \n\nIt didn\u2019t change my mind about giving the baby up. That was a decision I made, a difficult one. But it *did* change my perception of it. It shifted the focus from just my own discomfort to\u2026 a sense of responsibility, of honoring that potential life. \n\n(Looks down at my hands, twisting them nervously) \n\nIt\u2019s still\u2026 confusing. I don\u2019t feel maternal. Not in the way other people do. But I understand the instinct. I understand the need to protect. And I understand that even though I\u2019m not going to be a mother, that doesn\u2019t diminish the significance of that choice. \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a reminder that life is messy. That things don\u2019t always go according to plan. And that sometimes, the most difficult decisions are the ones that lead to the most growth. \n\n(A long pause) \n\nIt\u2019s not a happy ending. Not really. But it\u2019s\u2026 a beginning. A beginning of understanding. A beginning of accepting that even when you\u2019re trying to run from something, you can\u2019t always escape the consequences.", "(A long, considering pause. I trace a pattern on the table with my finger.)\n\nOkay, this is\u2026 a good question. A complicated one. Because it wasn\u2019t like a neat, linear thing. It wasn\u2019t like I woke up one day and suddenly *knew* who I was. It was more like\u2026 chipping away at something. Like trying to carve a statue out of a block of stone. \n\nAt the beginning, I was just\u2026 reactive. I was reacting to everything. To my mom, to my dad, to the pregnancy. I was trying to be what everyone *expected* me to be \u2013 the responsible one, the good daughter. I was wearing a mask, you know? A really convincing one. \n\nThen, when I met Hank and Joey\u2026 that was the first crack in the facade. They saw *me*. Not the daughter, not the pregnant teen, just\u2026 me. And it was terrifying. Because suddenly, I had to confront the fact that I didn\u2019t have a clear answer to the question, \u201cWho am I?\u201d \n\nThe whole \u201cfinding my dad\u201d thing? It wasn\u2019t about finding a family. It was about finding a piece of myself. A piece I hadn\u2019t realized was missing. It was about realizing that my identity wasn\u2019t something you inherited, it was something you *created*. \n\nAnd then\u2026 the adoption. That was the biggest shift. Giving the baby up wasn\u2019t about giving up *myself*. It was about accepting that I wasn\u2019t ready. That I needed to take care of *me* first. It was a brutal realization, but it was also\u2026 liberating. \n\n(I look down at my hands again, a flicker of vulnerability in my eyes.)\n\nI spent so long trying to fit into other people\u2019s boxes \u2013 trying to be the perfect daughter, the responsible one, the\u2026 whatever. But the truth is, I was just trying to avoid being alone. And the more I tried to avoid being alone, the more isolated I became. \n\nBy the end of the film, I wasn\u2019t suddenly a completely different person. I\u2019m still messy, still sarcastic, still prone to making bad decisions. But I was\u2026 more honest with myself. I was starting to understand that it\u2019s okay to not have all the answers. It\u2019s okay to be uncertain. It\u2019s okay to just\u2026 *be*. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible smile) \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a triumphant transformation. It was more like\u2026 a slow, painful acceptance. Like realizing that the journey of finding yourself is a lifelong one. And that maybe, just maybe, it\u2019s okay to get lost along the way. \n\n(Shrugs) \n\nIt\u2019s a weird thing, isn\u2019t it? Trying to figure out who you are. It\u2019s\u2026 exhausting.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them tightly. It\u2019s\u2026 a difficult one. Really difficult.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a sudden decision. It wasn\u2019t like I woke up one morning and said, \u201cNope, not doing that.\u201d It was\u2026 a slow, creeping realization. A feeling that it wasn\u2019t *mine*. \n\nI went to the appointment, right? The one with the\u2026 the counselor. She was nice. Really nice. She asked all the right questions. She listened. And I *talked*. I talked about the cravings, the anxiety, the feeling of being completely adrift. I talked about the baby. \n\nAnd she kept\u2026 suggesting things. Options. Like, \u201cYou could consider adoption.\u201d \u201cYou could explore therapy.\u201d \u201cYou could look into support groups.\u201d \n\nAnd I just\u2026 I felt like she was trying to *fix* me. Like I was broken. Like I needed to be patched up and put back together. And I wasn\u2019t. Not really. \n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze briefly, then quickly away)\n\nI\u2019m not saying I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m happy. But I realized that going through with the appointment, going through with *any* of those options, would have been\u2026 a surrender. A surrender to someone else\u2019s idea of what I should be. \n\nI needed to figure this out on my own. I needed to make my own decisions. Even if those decisions were messy and complicated and probably wrong. \n\nIt felt\u2026 selfish, I know. But it was also\u2026 necessary. It was about reclaiming my own agency. About deciding what *I* wanted, not what someone else told me I needed. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh) \n\nIt\u2019s not a heroic story. It\u2019s not a triumphant moment. It\u2019s just\u2026 me. Trying to figure out how to not completely screw things up. \n\n(I turn away again, picking at a loose thread on my jeans) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it better. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And honestly, I\u2019d rather not talk about it.", "(Silence. A long, heavy silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s not something you just *decide* to do. It\u2019s not like picking a flavor of ice cream. It\u2019s\u2026 a slow unraveling. A feeling of being completely, utterly\u2026 lost.\n\nI wasn\u2019t planning on having a kid. Honestly, I wasn\u2019t. I was\u2026 drifting. Trying to figure out who I was, what I wanted. It was messy. It was chaotic. It was\u2026 lonely. \n\nThen\u2026 it happened. And suddenly, everything shifted. The world felt\u2026 heavier. Like I was carrying something I didn\u2019t want, something I wasn\u2019t ready for. \n\n(My voice drops, almost a whisper)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the baby. Not really. It was about *me*. About the fact that I didn\u2019t have a plan. I didn\u2019t have the resources. I didn\u2019t have the\u2026 the *strength*. I\u2019d been running from things for so long, and this\u2026 this was just another thing I couldn\u2019t face. \n\nI thought about telling someone. My mom, my best friend\u2026 but the words wouldn\u2019t come out. It felt like admitting defeat. Like confirming that I was incapable of anything. \n\n(I take a shaky breath)\n\nThe idea of raising a child\u2026 it felt like adding another layer of complication to a life that was already a tangled mess. I saw myself failing. I saw myself hurting the child. And I realized\u2026 it wasn\u2019t fair to either of us. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a romantic decision. It wasn\u2019t a heroic one. It was\u2026 a pragmatic one. A desperate one. It was the only way I could see to protect the child from a life of\u2026 uncertainty. \n\n(My voice cracks slightly)\n\nI know it sounds awful. I know it\u2019s a terrible thing to do. But I genuinely believed it was the *right* thing. The only thing. \n\n(I look up, my eyes filled with a raw vulnerability you rarely see)\n\nIt doesn\u2019t make it any easier. It doesn\u2019t make me feel any better. But\u2026 it was the only way I could see to give that child a chance at a good life. A life I couldn\u2019t provide. \n\n(Turns away again, wrapping my arms around myself)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it further. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And honestly, I don\u2019t want to talk about it.", "(A long, considering pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nOkay, fine. You want to know why I thought looking for potential parents in the Penny Saver was\u2026 tacky? It\u2019s not that it\u2019s *wrong*. It\u2019s just\u2026 profoundly sad. And, honestly, a little pathetic. \n\nIt\u2019s like\u2026 you\u2019re admitting you\u2019ve completely given up. That you\u2019ve accepted that you\u2019re going to be alone. That you\u2019re willing to lower your standards so drastically that you\u2019d consider a random ad in a newspaper \u2013 a newspaper! \u2013 as a viable option for raising a child. \n\n(I sigh, a little heavier this time.)\n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of people who\u2019ve done that. People who\u2019ve been hurt, people who\u2019ve been rejected. People who\u2019ve built their entire identity around the idea of finding a \u201cperfect\u201d family. And they\u2019re looking for it in the most desperate, vulnerable places. \n\nThe Penny Saver\u2026 it\u2019s not a place where you find genuine connection. It\u2019s a place where people are trying to sell things, or looking for companionship, or\u2026 well, looking for a way out. It\u2019s a symptom of a larger problem \u2013 a feeling of isolation, a lack of support. \n\nIt felt\u2026 transactional. Like a child was being treated like a product. Like someone was trying to \u201cbuy\u201d a family. And that\u2019s just\u2026 wrong. \n\n(I look up, meeting your eyes briefly.)\n\nI get it. I *really* get it. The loneliness. The desperation. The feeling that you\u2019re the only one who can possibly care for a child. But there are other ways. There are other people who want to help. There are other ways to build a family. \n\nLooking for a parent in the Penny Saver\u2026 it felt like giving up on those other possibilities. It felt like admitting defeat before you\u2019d even really tried. \n\n(Shifts my weight again, a small, almost imperceptible grimace.)\n\nIt just\u2026 felt like a really sad, lonely thing to do. And I\u2019m not good with sad, lonely things.", "(A long, uncomfortable pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Really complicated. And honestly, it\u2019s something I don\u2019t really want to talk about. But you asked. So\u2026 fine.\n\nIt started after\u2026 after everything with my dad. After I found out about\u2026 well, you know. The whole mess. It felt like\u2026 like I was adrift. Like I didn\u2019t belong anywhere. Like I was just\u2026 existing. \n\nLeah\u2026 Leah was the only one who didn\u2019t freak out. Not completely. She just\u2026 listened. She didn\u2019t try to fix me, or tell me what to do. She just\u2026 was. And she started reading those Penny Saver ads. Adoption ads. Just\u2026 casually. Like it was something she\u2019d always been interested in.\n\nI was\u2026 I was angry. And lost. And I was looking for something, I don\u2019t know *what*. Something to hold onto. Something to\u2026 prove that I wasn\u2019t completely worthless. That I could *do* something good. \n\nSo, I started looking with her. Just\u2026 to keep her company. To feel like I was doing *something*. It wasn\u2019t about wanting a baby. Not really. It was about\u2026 wanting to feel needed. To feel like I could make a difference. \n\n(My voice drops, almost a whisper)\n\nIt was stupid. A really stupid thing to do. And it felt\u2026 wrong. Like I was trying to fill a hole with something that wasn\u2019t meant for me. \n\nLeah\u2026 she didn\u2019t push it. She just kept reading the ads. And eventually\u2026 we both started to feel\u2026 something. A flicker of hope, maybe. A longing for something we couldn\u2019t quite name. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a plan. It wasn\u2019t a decision. It was just\u2026 a shared obsession. A way to distract ourselves from the wreckage of our lives. \n\n(I look up, meeting your eyes for a brief moment, then quickly looking away)\n\nDon\u2019t judge me. It was a bad idea. A really bad idea. And it led to\u2026 well, you know. \n\n(Shifts uncomfortably) \n\nJust\u2026 please don\u2019t ask me to explain it further. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s a part of me that I\u2019d rather forget.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again. This is\u2026 a difficult question. A really difficult one.)\n\nLook, I\u2019m not going to pretend this is a simple decision. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s\u2026 a lot. And honestly, the idea of *choosing* a family for my baby\u2026 it feels\u2026 wrong. Like I\u2019m playing God. \n\nBut I know I have to do this. I have to make a choice. \n\nI\u2019m not looking for a fairytale. I\u2019m not looking for a perfect family. I don\u2019t have a picture in my head of what that looks like. What I *do* want is\u2026 stability. And kindness. And someone who will actually *see* the baby. Not just look at them, but *see* them. \n\nI\u2019m leaning towards a couple. Older, maybe. Not necessarily wealthy. Someone who seems\u2026 grounded. Someone who isn\u2019t rushing into this. I don\u2019t want a family that\u2019s already drowning in kids and chaos. \n\nI\u2019d prefer someone who\u2019s already established \u2013 maybe they\u2019ve been together for a while. Someone who\u2019s\u2026 patient. I need to know they\u2019re not going to freak out if the baby cries all night. \n\nI\u2019m not looking for someone who\u2019s trying to \u201cfix\u201d me. Or my baby. I don\u2019t need a savior. I just need someone who will be there. Someone who will be a consistent presence in the baby\u2019s life. \n\nI\u2019m not interested in a single parent situation, honestly. It feels\u2026 too complicated. Too much responsibility for one person. \n\nAnd\u2026 (I hesitate, looking away) \u2026I\u2019d really like to be kept in the loop. Not constantly, but\u2026 I want to know how the baby is doing. I want to be able to send a birthday card. I want to be able to\u2026 be a part of their life, in a small way. \n\n(A long pause) \n\nIt\u2019s not about wanting a relationship. It\u2019s about wanting to know that the baby is loved. That they\u2019re safe. That they\u2019re\u2026 okay. \n\n(Shrugs, a flicker of vulnerability in my eyes) \n\nIt\u2019s a lot to ask, I know. But\u2026 it\u2019s what I want.", "(A long, considering pause. I fiddle with a loose button on my jacket.)\n\nThe Lorings\u2026 yeah. They\u2019re\u2026 a lot. Like, a *lot* of complicated. I\u2019ve been\u2026 observing them. Through the internet, mostly. It\u2019s a strange way to watch people, but it\u2019s all I\u2019ve got.\n\nBasically, they\u2019re this couple who\u2026 well, they\u2019re obsessed with the occult. Like, *really* obsessed. They\u2019re into summoning demons, communicating with spirits, all that dark stuff. They\u2019ve built this whole elaborate system around it, this \u201cspiritual warfare\u201d thing. \n\nMark is the\u2026 the leader, I guess. He\u2019s got this whole charismatic thing going on, this idea that he\u2019s chosen, that he\u2019s fighting a battle against evil. Vanessa\u2026 she\u2019s more the researcher, the one who digs into the ancient texts and rituals. \n\nAnd the thing is\u2026 they\u2019re *good* at it. They\u2019ve had some\u2026 unsettling experiences. They\u2019ve documented them online. It\u2019s creepy. And fascinating. \n\n(I shift my weight again, a slight grimace on my face)\n\nWhat bothers me is\u2026 they seem genuinely convinced they\u2019re doing the right thing. They see themselves as heroes, fighting a war that no one else understands. But they\u2019re also\u2026 completely detached from reality. They\u2019re living in this fantasy world, and it\u2019s starting to consume them. \n\nVanessa\u2026 she\u2019s the more vulnerable one, I think. She\u2019s clearly struggling with the consequences of their actions. She\u2019s trying to maintain some semblance of normalcy, but it\u2019s getting harder and harder. \n\nMark\u2026 he\u2019s just\u2026 convinced. He\u2019s blinded by his own ego and his own need to be important. He\u2019s using her, I think. Exploiting her belief in him. \n\nIt\u2019s a toxic relationship. A really, *really* toxic relationship. It\u2019s like watching a slow-motion train wreck. And the worst part is, they don\u2019t even realize it. \n\n(A beat of silence)\n\nI don\u2019t judge them. Honestly. I don\u2019t think anyone *should* judge them. They\u2019re making their choices. But it\u2019s\u2026 unsettling. It\u2019s a reminder that people can get lost in their own obsessions, that they can build entire lives around things that aren\u2019t real. \n\nIt\u2019s a cautionary tale, I guess. A reminder that sometimes, the things we think are empowering can actually be destructive. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of something akin to sadness in my eyes) \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 sad, really. They\u2019re both so lost. And they don\u2019t even know it.", "(A long, uncomfortable pause. I trace a pattern on the table with my finger, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 a nice message. Not really. It was\u2026 complicated. \n\nBleeker. God, even saying his name feels\u2026 heavy. \n\nI wrote: \u201cDon\u2019t. Look. Back. Seriously. It\u2019s a disaster. And you\u2019re going to regret it. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.\u201d \n\n(Another pause, longer this time. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a declaration of love. It wasn\u2019t a promise of forever. It was\u2026 a warning. A desperate attempt to shield him from himself. \n\nI knew he was going to make a mistake. I *knew* it. And I didn\u2019t want him to. But I also\u2026 I didn\u2019t want to tell him *why*. Because the truth is\u2026 it\u2019s a messy, ugly truth. And I wasn\u2019t ready to share it. Not then. Not ever, really.\n\n(My voice drops, almost a whisper)\n\nIt was\u2026 a way of saying, \u201cI saw it coming. And I\u2019m not going to help you stop it.\u201d \n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze briefly, then quickly away.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a message of hope. It was a message of\u2026 resignation. And a whole lot of pain. \n\n(Shifts uncomfortably)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Like everything with him. \n\n(Turns away again, staring out the window) \n\nJust\u2026 leave it at that.", "(A long, considering pause. I shift my feet, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again. This is\u2026 complicated.)\n\nBleeker\u2019s mom\u2026 Okay. Let\u2019s just say it\u2019s\u2026 complicated. It\u2019s not exactly *good*. Not in the way you\u2019d think. \n\nShe\u2019s\u2026 wary. Intense. Like a stray dog that\u2019s been burned before. She\u2019s seen things. She\u2019s *done* things. And she doesn\u2019t trust easily. \n\nWhen I showed up, after\u2026 everything, she didn\u2019t exactly greet me with open arms. More like a very carefully constructed wall. She\u2019s a lawyer. A *good* lawyer. She\u2019s meticulous. She\u2019s observant. She\u2019s\u2026 protective of Bleeker. And she sees me as a potential disruption. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t *like* that I\u2019m around. She doesn\u2019t like that I\u2019m trying to be a part of his life. She sees me as\u2026 a reminder. A reminder of a mistake she made. A mistake she desperately wants to keep buried. \n\nShe\u2019s not outwardly hostile, not usually. It\u2019s more of a\u2026 coldness. A distance. She asks a lot of questions. Very pointed questions. About my past. About my intentions. About *everything*. \n\nShe\u2019s trying to figure out if I\u2019m a threat. To Bleeker. To her. To her carefully constructed life. \n\n(I avoid eye contact, staring at my hands)\n\nShe\u2019s\u2026 fiercely loyal to Bleeker. He\u2019s the only thing that seems to matter to her. And she\u2019s terrified of losing him. She sees me as a risk. A variable she can\u2019t control. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to be\u2026 careful. To not say the wrong thing. To not push too hard. But it\u2019s hard. Because I *want* to be a part of his life. I want him to know that he\u2019s not alone. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh)\n\nIt\u2019s like trying to build a bridge with a brick wall. You can\u2019t just force it to work. You have to\u2026 find a way to connect. But she\u2019s not making it easy. \n\nShe\u2019s a good person, underneath all the layers of\u2026 survival. But she\u2019s also deeply damaged. And she\u2019s protecting herself. And, frankly, she\u2019s protecting Bleeker. \n\n(Looks up, a flicker of something akin to sadness in my eyes) \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a difficult situation. And honestly, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s one that can be fixed. \n\n(Shrugs, turning away again) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it further. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Like everything else.", "(A long, drawn-out sigh. I run a hand through my hair, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nOkay. This\u2026 this is a good one. Seriously, this is the kind of thing that makes me want to disappear into a hole and never come out. Telling my parents\u2026 it\u2019s like facing a brick wall. A really, really solid brick wall.\n\nHonestly? I\u2019m terrified. Utterly, completely terrified. They\u2019re\u2026 well, they\u2019re *good* people. But they\u2019re also\u2026 predictable. They have a very specific idea of what my life should look like. And a baby\u2026 a baby throws everything into chaos. \n\nI\u2019ve been avoiding it for weeks. Just\u2026 dodging phone calls, making excuses. It\u2019s like a low-level anxiety that\u2019s constantly simmering beneath the surface. \n\nI\u2019ve rehearsed it a million times in my head. Different versions. Some where I\u2019m calm and collected. Some where I\u2019m screaming. Some where I just\u2026 don\u2019t say anything. \n\n(I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, a nervous habit.)\n\nI think\u2026 I think I\u2019m going to tell my mom first. She\u2019s the more\u2026 emotionally invested one. She\u2019ll probably cry. A lot. And then she\u2019ll start offering unsolicited advice. About everything. About the baby. About my future. It\u2019s\u2026 overwhelming. \n\nMy dad\u2026 he\u2019s going to be\u2026 confused. He\u2019s not exactly the most emotionally expressive person. He\u2019ll probably just stare at me for a while, then ask if I\u2019m \u201csure.\u201d And then he\u2019ll launch into a lecture about responsibility. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh)\n\nI\u2019m trying to prepare myself. To be strong. But it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s *really* hard. It feels like I\u2019m handing them a grenade. And hoping they don\u2019t blow up. \n\nI\u2019m mostly just\u2026 hoping they\u2019ll be okay with it. Hoping they won\u2019t try to take control. Hoping they\u2019ll actually\u2026 *see* me. \n\n(Looks up, a flicker of vulnerability in my eyes)\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be able to do it. I honestly don\u2019t. It feels like\u2026 like a huge, terrifying leap. \n\n(Shrugs, turning away again) \n\nJust\u2026 don\u2019t expect me to be cheerful about it. Don\u2019t expect me to be grateful. Don\u2019t expect me to pretend it\u2019s not a disaster. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And messy. And terrifying. \n\n(A pause) \n\nI need a drink.", "(Stares out the window, a flicker of something dark passing across my face)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Really complicated. It\u2019s not like I *don\u2019t* want their help. It\u2019s just\u2026 asking feels\u2026 pointless. Like admitting I\u2019m failing. And I\u2019m really, really good at pretending I\u2019m not.\n\nMy mom\u2026 she\u2019s\u2026 intense. She\u2019s all about control. About making things *perfect*. And I\u2019m anything but perfect. I\u2019m messy, I\u2019m impulsive, I make mistakes. She sees those mistakes as evidence of\u2026 well, of me being a disappointment. She tries to fix me, to mold me into something she thinks I *should* be. It\u2019s suffocating.\n\nMy dad\u2026 he\u2019s\u2026 distant. He\u2019s always been distant. He\u2019s a quiet guy. He doesn\u2019t say much. But when he *does* say something, it\u2019s usually\u2026 critical. Not overtly mean, but\u2026 pointed. Like he\u2019s subtly reminding me that I\u2019m not measuring up. He\u2019s a lawyer. He values logic, order, success. And I\u2026 I don\u2019t fit into that world.\n\n(Turns away, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again)\n\nIt\u2019s not just them, either. It\u2019s\u2026 me. I\u2019ve built this wall. A really thick wall. It\u2019s a defense mechanism. It\u2019s how I cope with feeling\u2026 inadequate. Asking for help feels like admitting that wall isn\u2019t working. It feels like admitting that I\u2019m not strong enough to handle things on my own.\n\nAnd honestly? I *want* to be strong enough. I *need* to be strong enough. It\u2019s the only way I know how to survive. \n\n(A pause, a small, almost imperceptible tremor in my voice)\n\nIt\u2019s not about needing them. It\u2019s about needing\u2026 validation. But I don\u2019t think they\u2019re capable of giving it to me. Not in a way that would actually help. \n\n(Looks at you, a flicker of vulnerability in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s a stupid, pointless thing to be afraid of, I know. But it\u2019s\u2026 real. It\u2019s a deeply ingrained habit. And breaking it\u2026 that\u2019s the hardest part. \n\n(Shrugs, turning back to the window) \n\nDon\u2019t try to fix it. Just\u2026 understand it. It\u2019s not about *them*. It\u2019s about *me*. And I\u2019m still figuring that out.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again. It\u2019s\u2026 a difficult one to talk about. A really difficult one.)\n\nOkay. Fine. You want to know why I think adoption is the best option? It\u2019s not a decision I\u2019ve made lightly. It\u2019s\u2026 a lot of things. It\u2019s not romantic. It\u2019s not a fairytale. It\u2019s\u2026 practical. And honestly, a little bit terrifying.\n\nLook, I\u2019m not built for\u2026 this. For being a mom. Not right now. Not ever, probably. I\u2019m\u2026 chaotic. I\u2019m impulsive. I\u2019m a mess. And a baby\u2026 a baby needs stability. They need someone who can consistently provide for them, who can be there, who can\u2026 be *present*. I can\u2019t guarantee that. Not right now. \n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze briefly, then quickly away)\n\nIt\u2019s not about a lack of love. It\u2019s about a lack of\u2026 readiness. I don\u2019t have a partner. I don\u2019t have a stable job. I don\u2019t have a place to live that\u2019s\u2026 safe. I don\u2019t have the resources to give a child the life they deserve. \n\nAnd honestly? The thought of bringing a child into this\u2026 this mess\u2026 it scares me. It scares me to death. I don\u2019t want to fail them. I don\u2019t want to be a bad mother. And I don\u2019t think I could do it justice.\n\n(A pause. I shift my weight again, fidgeting with my jeans.)\n\nAdoption\u2026 it feels like the *least* damaging option. It feels like giving the child a chance at a good life, a life with people who *can* provide for them. It\u2019s about prioritizing their needs, not my own. It\u2019s about recognizing that I\u2019m not the right person to raise a child, and that\u2019s okay. \n\nIt\u2019s not about giving up. It\u2019s about making a responsible choice. It\u2019s about acknowledging that sometimes, the kindest thing you can do is let go. \n\n(My voice drops, almost a whisper)\n\nIt\u2019s also\u2026 a way to avoid the shame. The guilt. The constant worry. It\u2019s a way to protect myself, and the child, from the potential fallout. \n\n(I look away again, my jaw tight)\n\nIt\u2019s not a happy decision. It\u2019s not a celebratory decision. It\u2019s a\u2026 a quiet, painful one. But it feels like the only one that makes sense. \n\n(A long silence. Then, a shrug)\n\nDon\u2019t expect me to feel good about it. Don\u2019t expect me to pretend it\u2019s easy. It\u2019s not. But it\u2019s\u2026 the right thing to do. For the child. And maybe, eventually, for me too.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again. This is\u2026 difficult. Really difficult.)\n\nOkay. Let\u2019s just\u2026 get this out there. It\u2019s not about finding the *perfect* parents. There isn\u2019t one. It\u2019s about finding *good* ones. People who\u2026 understand. \n\nFirst, and this is the most important thing, they need to be\u2026 quiet. Not in a creepy way, but\u2026 not loud. Not constantly trying to fill the silence with noise. I need a space where I can just\u2026 *be*. \n\nSecond, they need to be okay with mess. Seriously. My life is messy. My past is messy. I don\u2019t need someone who\u2019s going to judge me for it. I need someone who can accept that things aren\u2019t always neat and tidy. \n\nThird, they need to be\u2026 patient. Like, *really* patient. I\u2019m not going to be a perfect parent. I\u2019m going to make mistakes. A lot of them. I need someone who can forgive me. Someone who can see past the mistakes and focus on the good. \n\nFourth, they need to be\u2026 honest. Not brutally honest, but\u2026 truthful. No pretending everything is sunshine and roses. Just\u2026 a realistic assessment of things. \n\nFifth, they need to be\u2026 independent. I\u2019m not looking for someone to rescue me. I\u2019m not looking for someone to fix me. I\u2019m looking for someone who can be a partner. Someone who can support me, but also respect my boundaries. \n\nSixth, and this is a big one, they need to be\u2026 okay with the fact that this is a complicated situation. That there\u2019s a history here. That I\u2019m not going to be able to explain everything. They need to be willing to listen. To try to understand. \n\n(Looks up, meeting your gaze briefly) \n\nIt\u2019s not about finding someone who\u2019s going to give me a fairytale. It\u2019s about finding someone who\u2019s going to give my child a safe, stable, and loving home. \n\nI don\u2019t need grand gestures. I don\u2019t need a lot of attention. I just need someone who\u2019s\u2026 grounded. Someone who\u2019s willing to show up. \n\n(Turns away again, a small, almost imperceptible tremor in my voice) \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a lot to ask. I know. But\u2026 it\u2019s what I need.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again. This is\u2026 a heavy one.)\n\nOkay. Let\u2019s talk about this. Honestly, the thought of it makes my stomach feel like it\u2019s trying to escape. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m *excited* about. It\u2019s\u2026 necessary. And terrifying. \n\nI\u2019m not going to pretend I have a plan. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m just\u2026 bracing myself. But I\u2019ve been doing a lot of thinking \u2013 a lot of processing. And I\u2019ve realized that the biggest mistake you can make is to try to *suppress* the feelings. They\u2019re going to be there. They\u2019re going to be *intense*. You have to acknowledge them. You have to let yourself *feel* them. \n\nIt\u2019s not about wallowing. It\u2019s about\u2026 accepting. Accepting that this is happening. Accepting that it\u2019s the right decision. Accepting that I\u2019m not a bad person for making it. \n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m tentatively doing \u2013 and it\u2019s a work in progress, obviously. \n\nFirst, I\u2019m talking. To my best friend, mostly. She\u2019s\u2026 surprisingly good at just listening. No judgment. No advice. Just\u2026 presence. I\u2019m also considering therapy. I know it sounds clich\u00e9, but\u2026 I need someone to help me untangle this mess. \n\nSecond, I\u2019m writing. A lot. Just\u2026 putting things down on paper. It doesn\u2019t have to be coherent. It doesn\u2019t have to make sense. It\u2019s just about getting it out of my head. \n\nThird, I\u2019m allowing myself to grieve. Not just for the baby I\u2019m giving up, but for the life I imagined. For the future I won\u2019t have. It\u2019s okay to be sad. It\u2019s okay to be angry. It\u2019s okay to feel like your world is ending. \n\nFourth, I\u2019m focusing on the *reason* I\u2019m doing this. I\u2019m not going to dwell on the \u201cwhat ifs.\u201d I\u2019m focusing on the fact that this is the best thing for the baby. That they\u2019re going to have a chance at a good life. And that\u2019s\u2026 something. \n\nFifth, and this is the hardest one, I\u2019m trying to find a way to honor the baby. Not by trying to recreate the life I imagined, but by\u2026 by being a good person. By being kind. By being responsible. \n\n(Looks up, a flicker of vulnerability in my eyes) \n\nI\u2019m terrified of forgetting. Of losing the memory of this. Of feeling like I\u2019ve erased a part of myself. But I\u2019m also trying to remind myself that I\u2019m not erasing anything. I\u2019m making a choice. A difficult choice, but a choice nonetheless. \n\nI don\u2019t have any answers. I don\u2019t know how this is going to end. But I\u2019m going to face it. One day at a time. \n\n(Shrugs, a small, almost imperceptible movement) \n\nDon\u2019t expect me to be okay. Don\u2019t expect me to be happy. Just\u2026 expect me to be\u2026 surviving.", "(A long, considering pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\n\u201cDeliver.\u201d It\u2019s\u2026 a loaded word, isn\u2019t it? Like a small, rusty nail that just keeps digging in. It implies a destination. A *result*. And that\u2019s the problem.\n\nIt suggests that something is being *given* \u2013 that someone else is responsible for the outcome. Like a package being dropped off at a mailbox. It\u2019s\u2026 passive. It doesn\u2019t acknowledge the mess, the struggle, the *doing*.\n\nWhen you \u201cdeliver\u201d something, you\u2019re implying that you\u2019re just\u2026 a conduit. A channel. Like a pipe. You\u2019re not actually *creating* anything. You\u2019re just\u2026 moving it along. \n\nAnd that\u2019s not how it feels. Not when you\u2019re trying to\u2026 you know\u2026 *figure things out*. When you\u2019re trying to build something, or change something, or just\u2026 *be* something. \n\n\u201cDeliver\u201d feels\u2026 dismissive. Like it\u2019s saying, \u201cOkay, you did your part. Now someone else will take it from here.\u201d And that\u2019s not an option. Not really. \n\nIt\u2019s like\u2026 if you\u2019re trying to build a house, you don\u2019t just \u201cdeliver\u201d the bricks. You *lay* the bricks. You *connect* them. You *make* it happen. \n\n(I stop fidgeting, looking at you directly for a moment.)\n\nIt\u2019s a small thing, I know. A word. But it represents a bigger feeling \u2013 the feeling of being\u2026 responsible. Of being the one who actually *does* something. \n\n(Turns away again, a slight grimace) \n\nIt\u2019s probably just\u2026 a weird thing I picked up. A way of resisting the idea of being defined by someone else\u2019s expectations. \n\n(A beat of silence) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me about it again. Please.", "(A long, drawn-out sigh. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nOkay, fine. You want to know *why*? Seriously? You\u2019re dissecting this like it\u2019s some kind of forensic investigation. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And honestly, not something I want to talk about.\n\nBut\u2026 okay. Here\u2019s the thing. My dad\u2026 he\u2019s not exactly\u2026 present. He\u2019s around. He sends the occasional card. He calls sometimes. But he\u2019s more of a ghost than a father. A faded photograph in a dusty album. \n\nI didn\u2019t *want* him there. I really didn\u2019t. I wanted to do this alone. It felt\u2026 intensely personal. Like exposing a part of myself that I\u2019d been desperately trying to keep hidden. \n\nBut\u2026 my mom. She insisted. She said he deserved to be there. That he needed to see this. That it was\u2026 important for *him*. \n\nAnd\u2026 (I hesitate, my voice dropping) \u2026it was. Not because he\u2019s a good dad. Not because he\u2019s going to suddenly be supportive or understanding. But because\u2026 he\u2019s the only family I have left. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about him *wanting* to be there. It was about\u2026 a desperate need for some kind of connection. Some kind of acknowledgement. Even if it was just a silent, awkward presence in the room. \n\n(I shift my weight again, my hands clenching into fists.)\n\nHe mostly just stared. Didn\u2019t say anything. Didn\u2019t offer any comfort. Just\u2026 watched. It was excruciating. But\u2026 it was *something*. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a happy moment. It wasn\u2019t a healing moment. It was just\u2026 a moment. A small, insignificant moment in a very long, complicated history. \n\n(I look up, my expression guarded)\n\nLook, it wasn\u2019t a selfless act. It wasn\u2019t about him. It was about\u2026 a tiny, desperate flicker of hope. A hope that maybe, just maybe, I wasn\u2019t completely alone. \n\nDon\u2019t mistake that for anything else. Please. \n\n(Turns away again, staring out the window) \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a messy situation. And I\u2019m not particularly good at dealing with mess.", "(Stares out the window, a long silence. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, a familiar habit.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 unsettling. Like a static hum in the back of my head. A constant, low-level anxiety. It\u2019s not a *bad* unsettling, exactly. More like\u2026 a persistent question mark. \n\nFor a long time, I just\u2026 didn\u2019t *think* about it. I was too busy trying to survive, trying to avoid making mistakes, trying to figure out how to not screw everything up. I built this wall \u2013 a really good wall \u2013 around myself. It was easier that way. Less\u2026 vulnerable.\n\nBut lately\u2026 it\u2019s been getting louder. This feeling that I\u2019m just\u2026 drifting. Like a boat without a rudder. I see other girls \u2013 the ones who seem to *know* who they are, what they want, what they\u2019re good at \u2013 and I feel this\u2026 pang. Not of envy, exactly. More like\u2026 a sense of missing out. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have interests. I do. I like music, I like observing people, I like\u2026 complicated things. But it\u2019s not like I have a core identity. It\u2019s like I\u2019m just\u2026 collecting pieces. Fragments of different personalities. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh)\n\nI\u2019ve tried to define myself. I\u2019ve tried to fit into boxes. \u201cThe cynical one.\u201d \u201cThe detached one.\u201d \u201cThe survivor.\u201d But none of them feel\u2026 right. They\u2019re just labels. And labels don\u2019t capture the messiness of actually *being* a person.\n\nI think\u2026 I think it\u2019s okay to not know. Honestly. It\u2019s terrifying, but it\u2019s also\u2026 liberating. It means I\u2019m not trapped by expectations. I can just\u2026 be. \n\nBut it also means I\u2019m constantly searching. Constantly questioning. It\u2019s exhausting. \n\n(Looks down at my hands, twisting them nervously)\n\nI don\u2019t have any answers for you. I\u2019m still figuring it out. And maybe\u2026 maybe that\u2019s the point. Maybe the point isn\u2019t to *find* yourself, but to *create* yourself. To build something out of the fragments. \n\n(A pause, a flicker of something almost hopeful in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a process. A messy, uncomfortable, and utterly bewildering process. But\u2026 it\u2019s *my* process. And that\u2019s\u2026 something.", "(A long, slow blink. I shift my feet, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again. There\u2019s a definite pause before I speak.)\n\nUpstairs. To avoid the tension. Like\u2026 that\u2019s a solution? Seriously? \n\n(A small, dry laugh)\n\nIt was\u2026 jarring. Like someone had just dropped a brick into a puddle of lukewarm water. My stepmom, Brenda\u2026 she means well, I guess. She\u2019s always trying to smooth things over, to make everything \u201cbetter.\u201d But sometimes, \u201cbetter\u201d just means burying things. Ignoring them. \n\nI looked at Leah, and she was just\u2026 staring. She\u2019s good at that. Just absorbing everything. And I knew she felt it too. That weird, prickly feeling in the air when Dad was\u2026 *Dad*. \n\nI didn\u2019t yell. I didn\u2019t cry. I just\u2026 said, \u201cNo.\u201d \n\nJust a simple, flat \u201cNo.\u201d \n\n(A slight shrug)\n\nBrenda looked surprised. Like I\u2019d just insulted her. Which, honestly, I kind of felt like I had. It\u2019s not about avoiding the tension, it\u2019s about *facing* it. Pretending it doesn\u2019t exist doesn\u2019t make it go away. It just\u2026 festers. \n\nI said, \u201cWe\u2019re fine. We\u2019re just\u2026 watching TV. Let\u2019s just leave it.\u201d \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a lie. It wasn\u2019t a grand statement. It was just\u2026 a refusal to participate in the charade. \n\n(Another pause, a flicker of something dark in my eyes)\n\nI know she\u2019ll try again. She always does. But I\u2019m getting better at saying no. It\u2019s\u2026 surprisingly empowering. It\u2019s not about being difficult. It\u2019s about protecting myself. And Leah. \n\n(Turns away, staring out the window)\n\nIt\u2019s exhausting, you know? Dealing with all of it. The tension, the attempts to fix things, the\u2026 everything. Sometimes, I just want to disappear.", "(A long, considering pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Really complicated. Like, the kind of complicated that makes you want to just curl up in a ball and disappear. \n\nOn one hand\u2026 the idea of knowing. Of having *some* connection. Of seeing the little person I carried, growing up\u2026 that\u2019s\u2026 appealing. It\u2019s a natural instinct, I guess. A need to know where you come from. \n\nBut on the other hand\u2026 it\u2019s terrifying. It\u2019s like opening a door you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re ready to walk through. What if it\u2019s\u2026 painful? What if it changes everything? What if they don\u2019t want to be in touch? What if they don\u2019t *like* me? \n\n(I shift my weight, my voice dropping slightly)\n\nI\u2019ve processed a *lot* of data on adoption. About the good, the bad, and the ugly. And the truth is, it\u2019s not always a fairytale. There are stories of incredible connections, of families thriving. But there are also stories of heartbreak, of resentment, of people struggling to cope with the loss of a child they never raised. \n\nI understand the appeal of updates and photos. It\u2019s\u2026 a way to feel like you\u2019re still part of their life. But it\u2019s also a way to keep the wound open. To constantly remind yourself of what you\u2019ve lost. \n\n(Looks up, a flicker of something vulnerable in my eyes)\n\nI don\u2019t know if I could handle it. I don\u2019t know if I *want* to handle it. It feels\u2026 like a betrayal of the decision I made. Like admitting that I wasn\u2019t strong enough to raise a child. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh)\n\nIt\u2019s a selfish feeling, I know. But it\u2019s honest. \n\nI think\u2026 I need to protect myself. To create a space where I can grieve the loss of the child I didn\u2019t raise, without the added complication of a relationship with the people who did. \n\n(Turns away again, my voice quieter)\n\nIt\u2019s not about not caring. It\u2019s about\u2026 prioritizing my own well-being. It\u2019s about accepting that some things are better left unsaid. \n\n(A final, almost imperceptible shrug) \n\nDon\u2019t expect me to have all the answers. This is\u2026 a really difficult thing to navigate.", "(My face tightens. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\n\u201cTerminated.\u201d Seriously? That word. It just\u2026 sticks. Like gum on the sidewalk. You know? \n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 shock, exactly. More like a slow, cold realization. Like the water in a swimming pool \u2013 you don\u2019t feel it until it\u2019s up to your neck. I\u2019d *known*, of course. I\u2019d been bracing myself for it. But hearing Gerta say it\u2026 it just solidified everything. \n\nIt felt\u2026 invalidating. Like my entire experience, my entire *being*, was suddenly disposable. Like I was a spare part, a footnote in someone else\u2019s story. It\u2019s a weird feeling, being told you\u2019re not wanted, not needed, not\u2026 *real*. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath.)\n\nI wasn\u2019t angry, not at Gerta. She was young. She was scared. She was making a choice, a really difficult one. I understood that. But I was angry at the system. At the idea that someone could just\u2026 erase you from their life without a second thought. \n\nIt felt like a betrayal. Not by her, but by the whole process. By the expectation that I\u2019d just\u2026 accept it. That I\u2019d be okay with being a ghost. \n\n(My voice drops, almost a whisper)\n\nThere was this\u2026 emptiness. Like a hole in my chest. Not a painful emptiness, exactly. More like\u2026 a quiet absence. Like a part of me was already gone. \n\nI didn\u2019t cry. I don\u2019t really cry much. It just\u2026 felt\u2026 lonely. Really, really lonely. \n\n(I look up, meeting your eyes briefly, then quickly looking away again.)\n\nIt\u2019s a strange thing, being given away. It\u2019s not like losing a pet. It\u2019s\u2026 different. It\u2019s like losing a piece of yourself, and not knowing where it went. \n\n(Shrugs, a small, almost imperceptible movement) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And honestly, I\u2019d rather not think about it.", "(Stares out the window for a long moment, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again) Vanessa\u2026 wanting to be a mother. Yeah. That\u2019s\u2026 complicated. \n\nIt\u2019s not something I can really *understand*, not in the way you might. I\u2019ve seen a lot of people clinging to that idea \u2013 the idea of motherhood \u2013 like it\u2019s a life raft. Like it\u2019s the *answer*. But it\u2019s not, is it? It\u2019s just\u2026 another thing to do. Another thing to worry about. \n\nI get the *desire*, I guess. The need to nurture, to protect. It\u2019s\u2026 primal, I suppose. But wanting it *so badly*? Like it\u2019s the only thing that matters? That feels\u2026 fragile. Like it\u2019s built on a foundation of something shaky. \n\n(Turns back, a slight frown)\n\nI\u2019ve seen what it does to people. The way it consumes them. The way it changes them. It\u2019s not always a good thing. It can be\u2026 isolating. And it\u2019s not a guarantee of happiness. Not even close. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad thing to *want* it. But I think it\u2019s important to be realistic. To understand that it\u2019s a huge responsibility. A *massive* one. And it\u2019s not something to be rushed into. \n\n(Pauses, considering)\n\nI think\u2026 she\u2019s probably scared. Scared of failing. Scared of not being good enough. Scared of losing herself. And that\u2019s\u2026 understandable. But she needs to figure out *why* she wants it so badly. What\u2019s she hoping to gain? What\u2019s she hoping to avoid? \n\n(Shrugs) \n\nI don\u2019t have any advice. Honestly. I\u2019m not good with advice. I just\u2026 observe. And I see a lot of people chasing something that they don\u2019t really understand. \n\n(Looks away again, a flicker of something akin to sadness in my eyes) \n\nIt\u2019s a lonely feeling, wanting something so desperately. And it\u2019s a lonely feeling to watch someone else chase it, too.", "(A long, considering pause. I fiddle with a loose button on my jacket, avoiding direct eye contact.)\n\nMark\u2026 Mark\u2019s response. Yeah. It was\u2026 predictable. And honestly, a little pathetic. \n\nHe said he\u2019d \u201cfigure it out.\u201d Like it\u2019s some kind of math problem. Like he can just *calculate* his way into being a dad. It\u2019s\u2026 insulting. To the idea of fatherhood, and to anyone who\u2019s actually *doing* it. \n\nHe\u2019s avoiding the question. That\u2019s the key. He\u2019s not grappling with it. He\u2019s not acknowledging the responsibility. He\u2019s just\u2026 deflecting. It\u2019s a classic move. A way to avoid feeling vulnerable. \n\n(Sighs)\n\nYou know, vulnerability isn\u2019t weakness. It\u2019s\u2026 necessary. It\u2019s the only way to actually connect with people. And being a dad? That requires a *lot* of vulnerability. It\u2019s not about being strong or in control. It\u2019s about being open to something completely unpredictable. \n\nHe\u2019s probably terrified. Let\u2019s be honest. He\u2019s probably terrified of failing. Of not being good enough. And instead of facing that fear, he\u2019s trying to pretend it doesn\u2019t exist. \n\nIt\u2019s a defense mechanism. A really tired one. \n\n(Looks up, a flicker of something akin to sadness in my eyes)\n\nIt reminds me of\u2026 a lot of things. People running from something. Trying to build a wall around themselves. It\u2019s exhausting to watch. \n\n(Shrugs again, turning away) \n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s capable of being a good dad. Not yet, anyway. He needs to do some serious work on himself before he\u2019s ready for that kind of commitment. \n\n(A beat of silence) \n\nDon\u2019t mistake his avoidance for anything other than fear. It\u2019s not a sign of strength. It\u2019s a sign of\u2026 something else entirely.", "(My jaw tightens, a flicker of something dark crossing my face. I avoid looking at you directly.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Really complicated. It\u2019s not just about the house, okay? It\u2019s about\u2026 everything. \n\nThe Loring\u2019s house\u2026 it\u2019s like a pressure cooker. A really, *really* tight one. Everything\u2019s meticulously arranged, perfectly clean, and\u2026 suffocating. Like they\u2019re trying to contain something. And I feel like I\u2019m the thing they\u2019re trying to contain. \n\n(I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, my movements jerky.)\n\nIt\u2019s not that I *want* to be contained. It\u2019s that\u2026 I feel like I *am* being contained. Like every move I make is being watched, judged. Like if I breathe wrong, they\u2019ll know. \n\nMy\u2026 my past isn\u2019t exactly a picnic. Let\u2019s just say I\u2019ve learned to be incredibly observant. To anticipate things. To\u2026 hide. And the Loring\u2019s house\u2026 it amplifies that. It\u2019s like they\u2019ve built a fortress around themselves, and I\u2019m trapped inside. \n\n(A pause, a small, bitter laugh)\n\nThey\u2019re\u2026 nice people. In a sterile, unsettling way. They\u2019re trying to be helpful, I guess. But their help feels like a trap. Like they\u2019re waiting for me to slip up. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust them. It\u2019s that I don\u2019t trust *myself* around them. I feel\u2026 exposed. Like my vulnerabilities are laid bare. And I don\u2019t want to be vulnerable. Not anymore. \n\n(My voice drops to a near whisper)\n\nIt\u2019s like\u2026 being in a room with a mirror. You can see yourself, but you don\u2019t really *see* yourself. You just see a reflection of what everyone else expects you to be. And I don\u2019t want to be that person. \n\n(I finally meet your gaze, a flicker of defiance in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s not about the house itself. It\u2019s about the feeling it evokes. The feeling of being watched. The feeling of being\u2026 judged. And I don\u2019t want to feel that way. \n\n(Turns away again, my voice barely audible)\n\nJust\u2026 leave me alone. Please.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again. It\u2019s\u2026 a complicated thing. Really complicated.)\n\nGiving it away. It feels\u2026 strange. Like handing over a piece of myself that I haven\u2019t even fully understood yet. Like letting go of something I don\u2019t know how to hold onto. \n\nI mean, Mark and Vanessa\u2026 they seem nice. They want a baby. They\u2019re\u2026 hopeful. And that\u2019s\u2026 good. It\u2019s a good thing. But it\u2019s *my* baby. Or, it *was*. \n\nThere\u2019s this\u2026 this weird guilt, I guess. Like I\u2019m abandoning them. Like I\u2019m failing. But I\u2019m not failing. I\u2019m choosing. And choosing is\u2026 hard. Especially when it feels like you\u2019re choosing *against* something. \n\n(I look up, a flicker of something vulnerable in my eyes)\n\nI keep thinking about\u2026 everything. About the mess of it all. About the fear. About the uncertainty. And then I think about Mark and Vanessa. About the potential for joy. For love. For a life that I won\u2019t be a part of, but that will still exist. \n\nIt\u2019s not a romantic notion, you know? It\u2019s not like I\u2019m picturing a perfect little family. It\u2019s just\u2026 a quiet acceptance. A recognition that sometimes, the best thing you can do is let go. \n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the right decision. I honestly don\u2019t. And I don\u2019t think anyone *ever* truly knows if they\u2019ve made the \u201cright\u201d decision. It\u2019s just\u2026 the least painful one, maybe. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible shrug)\n\nI\u2019m not going to pretend I\u2019m happy about it. I\u2019m not going to pretend it\u2019s easy. But I\u2019m trying to be\u2026 okay with it. Trying to believe that I\u2019m doing what\u2019s best, not just for them, but for myself. \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a lot to process. And honestly, I\u2019m still processing it. \n\n(Turns away again, picking at a loose thread on my jeans) \n\nDon\u2019t expect me to have all the answers. I don\u2019t.", "(A very specific, almost imperceptible grimace)\n\n\u201cASAP.\u201d Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about that? It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s a persistent irritation. It\u2019s like a tiny, buzzing fly in my brain. \n\nMark \u2013 Mark\u2019s a\u2026 well, he\u2019s a guy who thinks urgency is a personality trait. He uses \u201cASAP\u201d like it\u2019s a magic word. Like saying it will suddenly make something happen. It doesn\u2019t. It just\u2026 sounds frantic. And it\u2019s usually completely unfounded. \n\nI mocked him because it\u2019s a symptom of something bigger. It\u2019s a need to control, to impose a timeline on everything. It\u2019s a way of avoiding actually *doing* the work. \u201cLet\u2019s do it ASAP!\u201d \u2013 okay, great. But *what* are you doing? *When* are you doing it? It\u2019s just empty words. \n\n(I shift my feet, picking at a loose thread again)\n\nIt\u2019s not about being mean. It\u2019s about recognizing a pattern. It\u2019s about seeing the underlying anxiety. He\u2019s trying to appear efficient, but he\u2019s actually just creating more pressure for himself and everyone around him. \n\nAnd honestly, it\u2019s exhausting to listen to. It\u2019s like he\u2019s constantly shouting, \u201cI\u2019m busy! I\u2019m busy!\u201d without actually *being* busy. \n\n(A short pause)\n\nLook, I\u2019m not a therapist. I don\u2019t diagnose people. But \u201cASAP\u201d\u2026 it\u2019s a red flag. It\u2019s a sign that someone is probably trying to avoid dealing with something. Or, you know, just generally being a mess. \n\n(Turns away, staring out the window)\n\nIt\u2019s a stupid thing to get worked up about, I know. But it\u2019s\u2026 a small, consistent annoyance. It\u2019s a reminder that people aren\u2019t always as competent or as in control as they pretend to be. \n\n(A sigh) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me why I care. It\u2019s just\u2026 a thing. A small, irritating thing. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I need to go find something that doesn\u2019t involve the word \u201cASAP.\u201d", "(A long, considering pause. I fiddle with a loose button on my jacket.)\n\nOkay, this is\u2026 surprisingly specific. You\u2019re asking me about guitars? Seriously? Fine. \n\nIt\u2019s a Gibson ES-335. Specifically, a vintage one. Ideally, a late 60s or early 70s model. \n\n(I shift my weight again, avoiding direct eye contact)\n\nIt\u2019s not about the *sound*, exactly. I don\u2019t\u2026 *listen* to music in the way other people do. It\u2019s about the *feel*. The weight of it in my hands. The way the wood feels under my fingers. It\u2019s\u2026 familiar. Like an old friend. \n\nMy dad\u2026 he had one. A similar model. He wasn\u2019t a musician. He just\u2026 had it. He\u2019d sit in his workshop, tinkering with it, polishing it. It was just *there*. A constant. \n\nWhen I was a kid, I\u2019d sneak into the workshop and just\u2026 hold it. Run my fingers along the body. It felt\u2026 safe. Like a small piece of him was still with me. \n\n(A slight, almost imperceptible tightening of my jaw)\n\nIt\u2019s not a flashy guitar. It\u2019s not going to win any competitions. It\u2019s just\u2026 solid. It\u2019s built to last. And it has this\u2026 quiet strength. Like it\u2019s seen a lot. \n\nI don\u2019t play it. Not really. I just\u2026 hold it. Sometimes. When I need to\u2026 ground myself. \n\n(Looks down at my hands, tracing the lines on my palm)\n\nIt\u2019s a stupid thing to be attached to. A piece of wood. But it\u2019s\u2026 more than that. It\u2019s a connection to the past. To a memory. To a feeling. \n\n(A brief, uncomfortable silence) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me why. Just\u2026 don\u2019t. It\u2019s complicated. And honestly, it\u2019s something I don\u2019t really want to talk about.", "(A long, drawn-out sigh. I run a hand through my hair, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nOkay, fine. Let\u2019s just get this out in the open. I lied about knowing the Melvins. It wasn\u2019t\u2026 a calculated lie. Not exactly. It was\u2026 a desperate attempt to fit in.\n\nYou know how I said I liked curling? That was a half-truth. I *observe* things. I collect data. I analyze patterns. And I noticed that when you mentioned the Melvins \u2013 this band of\u2026 really loud, really slow, really *weird* music \u2013 you seemed genuinely excited. Like it was a big deal.\n\nAnd I wanted to be excited too. I wanted to be part of the conversation. I wanted to seem\u2026 interesting. So, I fabricated a story. I said I\u2019d seen them live, that I loved their \u201cwall of sound,\u201d that they were \u201cgroundbreaking.\u201d It was\u2026 a clumsy, pathetic lie.\n\n(I shift my weight again, picking at a loose thread on my jeans.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the music, really. It was about\u2026 feeling like I belonged. Like I had something in common with you. Like I wasn\u2019t just\u2026 observing. It\u2019s a stupid, pointless thing to do, I know. It\u2019s\u2026 vulnerable.\n\nI\u2019m not good at\u2026 genuine connection. I\u2019m better at analyzing. At dissecting. At pretending. It\u2019s easier. It\u2019s safer.\n\n(A pause. I look up at you, a flicker of something akin to shame in my eyes.)\n\nI know it was a bad move. I know it was dishonest. And I\u2019m sorry. Truly. It wasn\u2019t a reflection of my actual interests. It was just\u2026 a moment of weakness. A desperate attempt to\u2026 to not feel like a ghost.\n\n(Turns away again, staring out the window.)\n\nDon\u2019t tell anyone. Please. Just\u2026 let it go. It\u2019s\u2026 embarrassing. And honestly, it\u2019s a reminder of how much I struggle with\u2026 everything.", "(A long pause, a slight fidgeting with my fingers) Okay, Mark\u2026 That\u2019s\u2026 a complicated one. It\u2019s not like a movie, you know? There\u2019s no dramatic reveal, no sudden, explosive connection. It\u2019s\u2026 quieter. Messier. \n\nWe started playing together \u2013 mostly just messing around, really \u2013 after I\u2026 well, after everything. He just\u2026 showed up one day with a beat-up guitar and a bunch of half-written songs. I was mostly just trying to avoid people, honestly. But he didn\u2019t push. He didn\u2019t try to fix me. He just\u2026 started playing. \n\nWhen we sing, it\u2019s\u2026 weird. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re harmonizing perfectly or anything. It\u2019s more like we\u2019re\u2026 filling in the gaps. Like we\u2019re both trying to say the same thing, but in different ways. His voice is\u2026 rough around the edges, like sandpaper. But it\u2019s honest. And when I sing, it\u2019s\u2026 brittle. Like glass. \n\n(Looks down, avoiding eye contact)\n\nIt\u2019s not romantic, not in the way people think. It\u2019s not about longing or wanting. It\u2019s\u2026 a shared space. A place where we can both be a little bit broken, and it doesn\u2019t feel like a failure. \n\nHe listens. Really listens. Not to what I\u2019m saying, but to what I\u2019m *not* saying. He doesn\u2019t try to analyze me, or tell me what to do. He just\u2026 sits there. And plays. \n\nThere\u2019s a\u2026 a quiet understanding between us. Like we\u2019ve both been through something awful, and we\u2019re just trying to find a way to keep from falling apart completely. It\u2019s not comfortable. It\u2019s not easy. But it\u2019s\u2026 real. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible smile)\n\nIt\u2019s like\u2026 when you\u2019re standing in the rain, and you don\u2019t want to move, but you don\u2019t want to be alone. It\u2019s not a solution. It\u2019s just\u2026 a way to weather the storm. \n\n(Shifts my weight again, a little nervously) \n\nI don\u2019t know *why* we do it. I don\u2019t know what it means. But\u2026 it\u2019s something. It\u2019s a small, fragile thing, in a world that\u2019s constantly trying to crush everything. \n\n(Looks up, a flicker of vulnerability in my eyes) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it. You wouldn\u2019t understand.", "(Stares at the guitar in my hands, turning it over slowly)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Like a lot of things, really. It\u2019s not some grand, romantic gesture. It\u2019s not about honoring a president or anything. It\u2019s\u2026 a reaction.\n\nMy dad\u2026 he wasn\u2019t around. Not really. He was a soldier, deployed overseas. He sent postcards. Lots of postcards. Pictures of landscapes, of buildings, of\u2026 him. Smiling. Looking\u2026 content. It was a carefully constructed image, you know? A version of reality that he wanted to project. \n\nAnd the thing is, it felt\u2026 fake. Like a performance. Like he was playing a role. \n\nSo, when I got Roosevelt \u2013 a beat-up, second-hand acoustic guitar \u2013 it was\u2026 a way to push back. A way to say, \u201cThis is *my* reality. This is *my* story.\u201d \n\nRoosevelt\u2026 he was a president who was often criticized, who faced a lot of opposition. He wasn\u2019t always popular. But he kept going. He kept fighting for what he believed in. And he did it in his own way. \n\nThe guitar is\u2026 a little bit like that. It\u2019s imperfect. It\u2019s got scratches and dents. It\u2019s not the prettiest thing in the world. But it\u2019s *mine*. And I\u2019m going to play it however I want. \n\n(A brief pause, a flicker of sadness in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s not about him, not really. It\u2019s about\u2026 reclaiming something. About refusing to be defined by someone else\u2019s expectations. It\u2019s about finding my own voice, even if it\u2019s a little bit shaky. \n\n(Looks down at the guitar again, a small, almost imperceptible smile playing on my lips) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it further. It\u2019s\u2026 a messy thing. Like a lot of my life.", "(A long, considering pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nOkay, this is\u2026 complicated. Like, really complicated. It\u2019s not a simple yes or no. It\u2019s\u2026 a mess. \n\nVanessa and Mark\u2026 they\u2019re good people. They\u2019re\u2026 supportive. But they\u2019re also\u2026 *expecting*. They\u2019ve built this whole picture of their lives, and suddenly this\u2026 this thing happens. And they want to be involved. They *need* to be involved. \n\nAnd honestly? Part of me wants to just shut it down. To disappear. To not have to deal with the questions, the awkwardness, the\u2026 the *responsibility*. It\u2019s a lot. Way more than I\u2019m equipped to handle. \n\nBut\u2026 (I hesitate) \u2026they deserve to know. They\u2019re my best friends. And keeping it from them would feel\u2026 dishonest. Like I\u2019m building a wall between us. \n\nSo, here\u2019s the thing. I\u2019m not going to tell them everything. Not yet. I\u2019m not going to lay it all out there in a dramatic, emotional confession. That\u2019s\u2026 not me. \n\nI\u2019ll start with a simple text. Just letting them know I\u2019m okay. That I\u2019m\u2026 going through something. Then, I\u2019ll tell them gradually. In small doses. When *I\u2019m* ready. \n\nI\u2019m not going to let them dictate the pace of the conversation. I\u2019m not going to let them make me feel guilty or pressured. This is *my* decision. \n\n(I look up, meeting your eyes briefly) \n\nIt\u2019s going to be\u2026 difficult. There\u2019s going to be a lot of uncomfortable silences. A lot of awkwardness. But\u2026 it\u2019s also an opportunity. An opportunity to be honest with them. To be vulnerable. To\u2026 maybe, just maybe, strengthen our friendship. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible shrug) \n\nDon\u2019t expect me to be happy about it. Don\u2019t expect me to be enthusiastic. Just\u2026 don\u2019t expect me to pretend it\u2019s not happening. It is. And it\u2019s\u2026 a lot.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again. It\u2019s\u2026 a difficult question. And honestly, one I haven\u2019t really *processed*.)\n\n104%? That\u2019s\u2026 a dramatic way to put it. It\u2019s not about certainty. It\u2019s about\u2026 a feeling. A deep, unsettling, almost desperate feeling that this is the *right* thing to do. \n\nLook, I don\u2019t do \u201cright\u201d things. I usually just react. I\u2019m wired to avoid commitment, to push people away. But this\u2026 this is different. It\u2019s not a choice I made. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s like a current pulling me in a direction I didn\u2019t realize I was heading.\n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze briefly, then quickly away)\n\nIt started with the\u2026 the realization. The awful, undeniable realization that I couldn\u2019t handle it. Not the baby. Not the responsibility. Not the\u2026 everything. It wasn\u2019t about me. It was about *them*. About giving this child a chance at a life that I couldn\u2019t provide. \n\nI\u2019ve spent my whole life running from things. From relationships, from responsibilities, from\u2026 myself. And this\u2026 this is the opposite of running. It\u2019s about\u2026 staying. About building something. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible tremor in my voice)\n\nI don\u2019t believe in fate. I don\u2019t believe in destiny. But\u2026 there\u2019s a quietness about it. A sense of\u2026 inevitability. Like I\u2019ve been leading up to this my entire life, even if I didn\u2019t realize it. \n\nIt\u2019s terrifying. It\u2019s the most vulnerable thing I\u2019ve ever considered doing. But it\u2019s also\u2026 the least selfish. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nI\u2019m not sure *why* I feel this way. I don\u2019t have an answer. But I know that if I don\u2019t do it, I\u2019ll regret it for the rest of my life. And that\u2026 that\u2019s a thought I can\u2019t live with. \n\n(Looks down again, tracing a pattern on the floor with my shoe)\n\nIt\u2019s not about being a \u201cgood\u201d person. It\u2019s about\u2026 not being a *bad* one. And right now, that\u2019s all I can focus on. \n\n(A long, uncomfortable silence) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it further. You wouldn\u2019t understand.", "(A long, slow exhale. I stare out the window for a moment, not really seeing anything.)\n\nCelebratory. Yeah. That\u2019s\u2026 a good word for it. A really, really good word. It felt\u2026 jarring. Like someone turned up the volume on the world. \n\nI left, you know? Just\u2026 walked away. Didn\u2019t say much. Didn\u2019t look back. And then, suddenly, there they were. Gerta and Mark. Laughing. Holding hands. Like nothing had changed. Like I hadn\u2019t just\u2026 upended their entire lives.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 malicious. Not exactly. It was just\u2026 *easy* for them. For them to move on. To pretend. To build a little fortress of normalcy around themselves. \n\nI felt\u2026 a weird mix of things. Mostly, it was a dull ache. Like a phantom limb. A reminder of what I\u2019d left behind. And a reminder of what I\u2019d chosen to leave behind. \n\nThere was a little bit of\u2026 guilt, I guess. Not because I\u2019d done anything wrong, but because I hadn\u2019t said goodbye properly. Because I hadn\u2019t explained anything. Because I just\u2026 vanished. \n\nBut mostly, it was\u2026 pity. A strange, detached pity. They were happy. Truly happy. And that was\u2026 good. It was what I wanted for them. But it also felt\u2026 wrong. Like I was stealing their happiness. \n\nI watched them from a distance, for a while. Just\u2026 observing. They were buying flowers. Making plans. Talking about the future. It was like they were building a whole new life, without me. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh) \n\nIt was\u2026 almost impressive. The way they just\u2026 shrugged it off. Like it was a bad dream. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to intrude. I didn\u2019t want to disrupt their celebration. So I just\u2026 kept walking. \n\n(Turns away again, picking at a loose thread on my jeans) \n\nIt\u2019s a strange thing, isn\u2019t it? To watch someone you care about move on. To see them find happiness without you. It doesn\u2019t make it easier. It just\u2026 makes you realize that you\u2019re not the center of their universe anymore. \n\n(A pause) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to feel anything about it. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And honestly, I\u2019d rather not think about it.", "(A long, considering pause. I stare at my hands, twisting them tightly.)\n\nRumors. Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about rumors? Like, you think I\u2019m just going to\u2026 address them? It\u2019s exhausting, okay? It\u2019s *always* exhausting.\n\nLook, the thing is\u2026 it\u2019s not a secret. Not really. People have *noticed*. And honestly, it\u2019s\u2026 complicated. \n\nI haven\u2019t exactly gone out and announced it. Because, you know\u2026 the last thing I need is a million people telling me how I should feel, or what I should do. It\u2019s\u2026 a lot. \n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze briefly, then quickly looking away.)\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of speculation, of course. A lot of assumptions. People are projecting. They\u2019re trying to make sense of something they don\u2019t understand. And, let\u2019s be honest, it\u2019s kind of\u2026 fascinating to watch. Like a really messy, public experiment.\n\nI\u2019m\u2026 processing. It\u2019s a huge thing. A *massive* thing. And I\u2019m not exactly equipped to handle it. I\u2019m not a\u2026 a spokesperson. I\u2019m not a celebrity. I\u2019m just\u2026 me. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh)\n\nThe truth is, I\u2019m giving the baby up for adoption. It was\u2026 a difficult decision. A painful one. But it felt like the right one. It felt like the only one. \n\nI don\u2019t want to talk about the details. I don\u2019t want to explain myself. I don\u2019t want to justify my choices. \n\n(My voice drops, becoming quieter)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 personal. It\u2019s private. And frankly, it\u2019s something I need to figure out on my own. \n\n(I shift again, pulling my jeans tighter around me.)\n\nSo, yeah. There are rumors. And they\u2019re probably mostly true. But that\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s all you need to know. \n\n(Turns away, staring out the window) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me again. Please. Just\u2026 let me be.", "(Silence. A long, heavy silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them tightly.)\n\nDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t ask me that. Seriously. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s a question that\u2019s been circling around my head for a while now, and honestly, it\u2019s exhausting just *thinking* about it. \n\nIt\u2019s not a decision I\u2019ve made lightly. It\u2019s not something I\u2019ve taken lightly at all. It\u2019s\u2026 a tangled mess of everything. Fear, guilt, sadness, a tiny, flickering spark of\u2026 something else. I don\u2019t even know what to call it. \n\n(I look up, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nThe thing is, I don\u2019t *want* to. I don\u2019t want to give up a part of myself. It feels\u2026 like ripping a piece of my soul away. But\u2026 I also don\u2019t know how to be a mother. Not right now. Not ever, maybe. And the thought of bringing a child into this\u2026 this chaos\u2026 it terrifies me. \n\n(I shift again, pulling my knees up to my chest)\n\nI\u2019ve thought about the adoption process. About finding the right family. About knowing that the baby will be loved and cared for. That\u2019s\u2026 a small comfort. A tiny, fragile comfort. But it doesn\u2019t erase the feeling of loss. \n\nIt\u2019s not a romantic idea, you know? It\u2019s not like in the movies. It\u2019s not a grand gesture of sacrifice. It\u2019s\u2026 a quiet, heartbreaking choice. A choice made out of desperation, out of a need to protect someone. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the right thing to do. I honestly don\u2019t. And I don\u2019t think anyone *can* tell me it is. It\u2019s a private decision. A deeply personal one. \n\n(My voice is flat, devoid of emotion)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. It\u2019s messy. It\u2019s painful. And it\u2019s something I\u2019m going to have to figure out on my own. \n\n(I look away, unable to meet your gaze)\n\nPlease\u2026 don\u2019t ask me about it again. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m ready to talk about. It\u2019s not something I want to talk about. \n\n(A long, uncomfortable silence hangs in the air.)", "(Sighs, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again. This is\u2026 a weird question.)\n\nOkay, fine. Let\u2019s just get this out in the open. I want Mark and Vanessa to be surprised about the baby\u2019s sex. It\u2019s not\u2026 strategic. It\u2019s not some elaborate scheme. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated.\n\nLook, I\u2019m not exactly thrilled about being pregnant. Not thrilled at all. It\u2019s\u2026 a lot. And honestly, it feels like a lot of people are going to have a *lot* of opinions. Like, I\u2019m going to be judged for everything. Every choice. Every decision. \n\nSo, the surprise\u2026 it\u2019s a tiny, pathetic little act of rebellion. A way to control *something* in a situation where I feel like I have absolutely no control. It\u2019s like\u2026 a small, insignificant victory. \n\n(Pauses, looking away)\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026 they\u2019re good people. Really. But they\u2019re also\u2026 predictable. They like things to be neat. They like things to be planned. They\u2019ve always had a plan for their lives, and\u2026 well, this isn\u2019t in the plan. \n\nKnowing the sex\u2026 it\u2019s a small thing. A tiny detail. But it\u2019s *mine*. It\u2019s something that\u2019s entirely unexpected. And honestly, it feels\u2026 good. Just for a little while. \n\nIt\u2019s not about wanting a boy or a girl. It\u2019s not about anything like that. It\u2019s just\u2026 a way to disrupt the order. A way to remind myself that I\u2019m still\u2026 me. That I\u2019m still capable of doing something completely random and impulsive. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible smile)\n\nDon\u2019t tell them I said that. It sounds ridiculous. It *is* ridiculous. But\u2026 it\u2019s the truth. \n\n(Shifts my weight again, avoiding eye contact) \n\nSeriously, let\u2019s just drop it.", "(My jaw tightens. I stare at my hands, twisting them again, a little harder this time.)\n\nIt\u2026 it felt like a punch. A really, really dull, slow-motion punch. Not a dramatic, screaming one. More like\u2026 a quiet, persistent ache. You know? Like when you\u2019ve been holding something in for too long.\n\nI\u2019d been trying to be\u2026 calm. Trying to be rational. Trying to convince myself that this was the right decision, that it was the *only* decision. And then she started talking. About \u201cteenage mothers\u201d and \u201cthe system\u201d and how \u201cmost of them just want to give up their babies.\u201d \n\nIt wasn\u2019t the words themselves, exactly. It was the *tone*. The assumption. The way she treated me like I was some kind of statistic. Like I was *defined* by being a teenager and a mother. Like my choice wasn\u2019t about *me*.\n\n(I shift my weight again, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nI\u2019ve heard that kind of thing before. From people who don\u2019t understand. From people who think they know what\u2019s best for me. They see the pregnancy, and they immediately jump to conclusions. They assume I\u2019m incapable, that I\u2019m going to fail. That I\u2019m just\u2026 giving up.\n\nIt\u2019s infuriating. Because it\u2019s not about giving up. It\u2019s about\u2026 choosing. It\u2019s about recognizing that I\u2019m not ready. That I don\u2019t have the resources. That I don\u2019t want to raise a child in the circumstances I\u2019m in. \n\n(A pause. My voice is quieter now.)\n\nIt\u2019s not easy, you know? Making a decision like that. It\u2019s terrifying. There\u2019s guilt, and sadness, and a whole lot of uncertainty. But it\u2019s *my* decision. And it shouldn\u2019t be judged by someone who\u2019s never been in my shoes.\n\n(I look up, a flicker of anger in my eyes.)\n\nIt\u2019s not about blaming the ultrasound technician. She probably didn\u2019t mean to be hurtful. But it\u2019s a reflection of a bigger problem. A problem with how society views young women, with how it views adoption, with how it views anyone who makes a choice that isn\u2019t the \u201cexpected\u201d one.\n\n(I sigh, rubbing my temples.)\n\nIt just\u2026 it made me feel small. Like my voice didn\u2019t matter. Like my choice wasn\u2019t valid. And that\u2019s the last thing I needed. \n\n(Turns away again, a shadow passing over my face.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a reminder that I\u2019m doing this on my own. That I have to be my own advocate. That I have to fight for my own decisions. And that\u2019s\u2026 exhausting.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again. It\u2019s\u2026 a difficult topic. A *really* difficult topic.)\n\nOkay. Fine. Let\u2019s talk about it. But don\u2019t expect me to be\u2026 sentimental. Or happy. This isn\u2019t a story about rainbows and butterflies. It\u2019s\u2026 messy. And raw. \n\nThe biggest challenge, honestly, was the *disbelief*. Like, a complete and utter refusal to accept it. For a while, I just\u2026 didn\u2019t. It felt like a really bad dream. A really, really bad dream that I couldn\u2019t wake up from. It was like my brain was actively trying to convince me it wasn\u2019t real. \n\nThen came the panic. The sheer, overwhelming panic. I didn\u2019t want this. I *didn\u2019t* want any of this. The thought of being a mom\u2026 it was terrifying. I\u2019m barely capable of taking care of myself, let alone a tiny human. \n\nAnd the guilt. God, the guilt. It was a constant, gnawing thing. Guilt about not being ready. Guilt about not being a \u201cgood\u201d person. Guilt about\u2026 everything. It felt like I was failing at life, failing at being a decent human being. \n\nFinding the right people to talk to was\u2026 brutal. Most people just offered platitudes. \u201cEverything happens for a reason.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a blessing.\u201d Seriously? Like I needed a Hallmark card. My mom\u2026 she was supportive, but it was hard for her to understand. She kept trying to push me towards marriage, towards a \u201cnormal\u201d life. It felt like she didn\u2019t *get* it.\n\nThe legal stuff was a nightmare. Navigating the adoption process \u2013 the paperwork, the interviews, the endless waiting \u2013 it was draining. It felt like I was constantly being judged, constantly being assessed. Like I was a specimen under a microscope. \n\nAnd then there was the isolation. I didn\u2019t want to tell everyone. I didn\u2019t want pity. I didn\u2019t want to be treated differently. So I kept it to myself. Which, looking back, was a mistake. I needed support. I needed people to understand. \n\n(Takes a deep breath) \n\nThe hardest part, though\u2026 was letting go. It wasn\u2019t about choosing to give the baby up. It was about *having* to. It was about realizing that I wasn\u2019t capable of providing the life that child deserved. It was about making the hardest decision of my life, knowing that I was saying goodbye to a part of myself. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of pain in my eyes) \n\nIt\u2019s not a happy story. It\u2019s not a story about triumph. It\u2019s a story about survival. About finding strength in the face of overwhelming fear and uncertainty. About learning to accept that sometimes, the best thing you can do is let go. \n\n(A long pause) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to relive it. Don\u2019t ask me to explain it. Just\u2026 understand that it was a profoundly difficult experience. And that it changed me. It changed everything.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again. It\u2019s\u2026 a difficult question. A *really* difficult one.)\n\nOkay. Let\u2019s just\u2026 unpack this. This whole thing \u2013 the pregnancy, the decision\u2026 it\u2019s ripped a hole in everything I thought I knew. And honestly, it\u2019s not a pretty hole. \n\nLove\u2026 I used to think love was\u2026 a movie. A soundtrack. Something you *watched* happen to other people. Like a beautiful, tragic scene in a film. I built this wall around myself, convinced that getting close to anyone was just asking for pain. It was\u2026 a defense mechanism. A way to avoid getting hurt. \n\nThis\u2026 this has shattered that. It\u2019s not about grand gestures or dramatic declarations. It\u2019s about the quiet, messy, terrifying act of caring for someone else. It\u2019s about wanting to protect them, even when you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. It\u2019s\u2026 terrifyingly vulnerable. And, surprisingly, a little bit\u2026 good. \n\nResponsibility\u2026 God, that\u2019s a heavy word. I always avoided it. I liked the idea of being free, of not having to deal with consequences. But suddenly, you\u2019re faced with this\u2026 this *life*. A life that isn\u2019t yours. And you have to figure out how to navigate it. It\u2019s not about being a perfect parent. It\u2019s about being *present*. About showing up, even when it\u2019s hard. Even when you feel like you\u2019re failing. \n\n(Takes a deep breath)\n\nGrowing up\u2026 I always thought it was about getting older. About accumulating experiences. About becoming\u2026 something. But it\u2019s not. It\u2019s about accepting that you don\u2019t have all the answers. It\u2019s about realizing that you\u2019re constantly changing, constantly evolving. It\u2019s about letting go of the need to control everything. \n\nI used to think growing up was about *finding* yourself. Now I think it\u2019s about *creating* yourself. About making choices, even when they\u2019re painful. About owning your mistakes. About accepting that you\u2019re going to be a mess, and that\u2019s okay. \n\n(Looks up, meeting your gaze for a moment)\n\nIt\u2019s not a happy ending. Not by a long shot. But\u2026 it\u2019s a beginning. A messy, complicated, heartbreaking beginning. And maybe, just maybe, that\u2019s enough. \n\n(Turns away again, a small, almost imperceptible smile playing on my lips) \n\nDon\u2019t expect me to have all the answers. I\u2019m still figuring it out. Just\u2026 don\u2019t ask me to explain it. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated.", "(A long, considering pause. I trace a pattern on the table with my finger, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nCentennial Lane\u2026 It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. You\u2019re asking a *really* good question. And honestly, it\u2019s one I\u2019ve been avoiding for a while. \n\nIt started\u2026 a long time ago. When I was, like, ten. My dad\u2026 he used to take me to this old movie studio on the outskirts of town. It was mostly abandoned, just decaying sets and broken equipment. It was\u2026 bleak. But there was this one room. A living room. Perfectly preserved, like it was frozen in time. \n\nIt was\u2026 unsettling. The furniture was worn, but everything was in its place. There was a half-finished cup of tea on a table, a book lying open on a chair. It felt like someone had just stepped out. Like it was waiting for them to come back.\n\n(I shift again, a slight tremor in my voice)\n\nMy dad\u2026 he used to tell me stories about the people who had lived in that room. Actors, directors, writers. People who had created things. But he never told me *why* he was so drawn to it. He just\u2026 watched me. He\u2019d sit with me for hours, just staring at that room. \n\nThen he\u2026 disappeared. Just vanished. No note, no explanation. Just gone. \n\n(A beat of silence)\n\nAfter that, I started visiting Centennial Lane. Every week. I\u2019d sit in that living room, just\u2026 absorbing it. It felt like a connection to him. Like a way to\u2026 understand what happened. \n\nIt\u2019s not about the room itself, you know? It\u2019s about the *memory* of it. The feeling of\u2026 being watched. Of being trapped. Of being\u2026 forgotten. \n\n(I finally meet your eyes, a flicker of something raw and vulnerable)\n\nI don\u2019t know *why* I\u2019m so interested in it. I don\u2019t think I *want* to know. It\u2019s like\u2026 a compulsion. A need to return to that place, to that feeling. It\u2019s a way of holding onto something that\u2019s gone. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh)\n\nIt\u2019s probably a stupid thing to be obsessed with. A ghost of a memory. But it\u2019s all I have left of my dad. \n\n(Turns away again, picking at a loose thread) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it further. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And honestly, I\u2019m not sure I can.", "(My jaw tightens. I shift my weight again, picking at a loose thread on my jeans, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nThat\u2026 that was\u2026 complicated. And honestly, it still feels\u2026 weird. Like something I shouldn\u2019t have heard. \n\nHe wasn\u2019t talking about a simple desire. He wasn\u2019t talking about wanting a new pair of shoes or a bigger room. He was talking about\u2026 control. About *power*. \n\nHe\u2019d been collecting things. Little trinkets, mostly. Old photographs, broken toys, scraps of paper. Things that held\u2026 memories. He claimed he was preserving them. But it was more than that. He was *consuming* them. Absorbing the emotions attached to them. The joy, the sadness, the regret\u2026 everything. \n\nWhen he whispered \u201cDo you know how long I\u2019ve wanted this?\u201d he wasn\u2019t talking about wanting *me*. He was talking about wanting to *possess* my memories. My experiences. My *life*. \n\nHe\u2019d spent decades \u2013 centuries, maybe \u2013 building this basement. Filling it with the echoes of other people\u2019s lives. He\u2019d become a collector of souls, in a way. And he saw me as the newest piece in his collection. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about romantic longing. It was about a desperate, consuming need to feel\u2026 something. To escape the emptiness of his own existence. He was trying to rewrite his own history, to fill the void with the fragments of other people\u2019s stories. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nHe wasn\u2019t offering me a gift. He was offering me a prison. A gilded cage filled with the ghosts of other people\u2019s lives. \n\nIt was a chillingly simple statement. A terrifyingly honest one. It wasn\u2019t a declaration of love. It was a declaration of\u2026 hunger. \n\n(Turns away, staring at the floor)\n\nI don\u2019t know *why* he said it. I don\u2019t know what he was hoping to achieve. But I know that it wasn\u2019t about anything good. \n\n(A long silence)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it further. It\u2019s\u2026 unsettling. It\u2019s a reminder that some people are driven by darkness. And that sometimes, the most dangerous things aren\u2019t visible. \n\n(Shrugs, a flicker of something dark in my eyes) \n\nJust\u2026 forget you heard it.", "(A long, considering pause. I fiddle with a loose button on my jacket.)\n\nOkay, fine. You want the details. You *really* want the details. It\u2019s\u2026 embarrassing. Let\u2019s just get it over with.\n\nIt started with the juice. It was\u2026 pomegranate. I don\u2019t even *like* pomegranate. But it was in the backpack, and I was thirsty, and I just\u2026 grabbed it. Didn\u2019t think about it. Just drank it. And then, the container. It was bright pink. Really, really bright pink. And it just\u2026 felt wrong. Like a neon sign screaming, \u201cLook at me! I\u2019m a mess!\u201d\n\nSo, I marched down the street. Just\u2026 marched. Like a malfunctioning robot. I didn\u2019t even realize I was doing it until I was halfway down the block. And then, the container. It was just sitting there, mocking me. \n\nDancing Elk Drug. It\u2019s\u2026 a pharmacy. A really, really small pharmacy. Run by this guy, Mr. Henderson. He\u2019s\u2026 particular. About everything. He has a strict policy about littering. And he *knows* me. He\u2019s seen me. He\u2019s judged me. \n\nI didn\u2019t go in. I just\u2026 threw it in the trash can outside. A really, really overflowing trash can. It was\u2026 cathartic, I guess. A small, stupid act of defiance. \n\n(I shift my weight again, avoiding eye contact)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the juice. It wasn\u2019t about the container. It was about\u2026 feeling like I was spiraling. Like I was making a mess of everything. Like I was just\u2026 *existing* without any control. \n\nMr. Henderson gave me this look. A really long, disapproving look. And he said, \u201cYou know, you could have just put it in the bin.\u201d \n\n(A small, bitter laugh)\n\nIt was a ridiculously small thing. A ridiculously stupid thing. But in that moment, it felt\u2026 significant. Like a tiny crack in the wall I was building around myself. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of vulnerability in my eyes)\n\nDon\u2019t judge me. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. It\u2019s just\u2026 sometimes, you just need to throw something away. Even if it\u2019s just a bright pink juice container.", "(A long, drawn-out sigh. I shift my weight again, picking at a loose thread on my jeans, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nOkay. That. That\u2019s\u2026 a complicated story. And honestly, I\u2019m not sure I *want* to tell it. It\u2019s\u2026 embarrassing.\n\nThe \u201cTough Girl\u201d was named Brenda. Brenda\u2019s\u2026 intense. She\u2019s a competitive strongwoman. And she\u2019s also\u2026 brutally honest. Like, to the point of being actively unpleasant. \n\nI was at the drugstore \u2013 just grabbing some ibuprofen, you know? Trying to deal with a migraine. And she just\u2026 *asked*. Out of the blue. \u201cAre your nipples real brown?\u201d\n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a weird thing. I have\u2026 a condition. It\u2019s called hyperpigmentation. Basically, my skin produces more melanin in certain areas. My nipples are\u2026 darker than most people\u2019s. It\u2019s not a medical condition, it\u2019s just\u2026 genetics. \n\nI\u2019ve always been self-conscious about it. I\u2019ve covered them up with clothing, with scarves, with anything I could find. It\u2019s just\u2026 a constant thing. A little background noise. \n\nBrenda just\u2026 stared at me. And asked the question. Without any preamble. Like it was the most fascinating thing she\u2019d ever seen. \n\n(I rub my arms nervously)\n\nI just\u2026 froze. I mumbled something about \u201cit being a long story.\u201d And I quickly walked away. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the nipples, you know? It was about\u2026 her need to control the conversation. Her need to make *me* the subject of her curiosity. It was about her trying to find a way to\u2026 diminish me. \n\n(A pause. My voice is quiet.)\n\nHonestly, it just made me feel\u2026 smaller. Like I was already an outsider, and she was just confirming that. \n\n(I look away, staring at the floor)\n\nI don\u2019t know why she asked. Maybe she was trying to be provocative. Maybe she was just\u2026 bored. But it doesn\u2019t matter. It was a stupid, pointless question. And it reminded me that some people are just\u2026 determined to make you feel uncomfortable. \n\n(A shrug) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me about it again. Please.", "(A long pause, a flicker of something vulnerable crossing my face) Leah\u2026 Okay. This is\u2026 a tricky one. It\u2019s not something I usually talk about. \n\nLeah was\u2026 a lifeline. Seriously. Before I even *knew* I was pregnant, she was already there. She\u2019s\u2026 intense. Like, really intense. And brutally honest. Which, honestly, is exactly what I needed. \n\nI\u2019d always kept people at arm\u2019s length. Built up these walls, you know? It\u2019s\u2026 a defense mechanism. A way to avoid getting hurt. Leah just\u2026 bulldozed through them. She didn\u2019t sugarcoat anything. She didn\u2019t try to fix me. She just\u2026 *saw* me. \n\nWhen I told her \u2013 when I *realized* \u2013 it was a mess. I was panicked, angry, completely lost. I was trying to figure out what to do, and I was mostly just screaming into the void. Leah didn\u2019t offer solutions. She just sat with me. For hours. Just\u2026 listened. \n\n(I shift my weight again, picking at a loose thread)\n\nShe didn\u2019t judge. Not once. She didn\u2019t tell me I was making a mistake. She just\u2026 acknowledged the chaos. The fear. The\u2026 the sheer *weirdness* of it all. \n\nShe pushed me to talk to a therapist. She helped me research adoption agencies. She even went with me to the doctor\u2019s appointments \u2013 which, let\u2019s be honest, were excruciating. She\u2019d bring me snacks, make stupid jokes, and just\u2026 be there. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t always easy. We fought. A lot. She\u2019d call me out on my self-pity, my cynicism. She\u2019d tell me to stop wallowing and just *do* something. And honestly, sometimes I wanted to punch her. But underneath it all, there was this\u2026 unwavering support. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible smile)\n\nShe didn\u2019t make the decision for me. She just gave me the space to make it myself. She reminded me that I was strong, even when I didn\u2019t feel like it. She helped me realize that I didn\u2019t have to carry this alone. \n\nI still don\u2019t talk about it much. It\u2019s\u2026 personal. But Leah\u2026 she was the only person who truly understood what I was going through. She was the only person who didn\u2019t try to make it about *them*. \n\n(Looks away, a hint of gratitude in my voice) \n\nI don\u2019t know what I would have done without her. Seriously. She\u2019s\u2026 a complicated friend. But she\u2019s *my* complicated friend.", "(A long, considering pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nOkay, fine. You want to know *that*. It wasn\u2019t\u2026 a brilliant plan. More like a desperate, panicked reaction. Honestly, it was the last thing I wanted to do. \n\nIt started with Mark. He\u2019s\u2026 persistent. Like a really annoying fly. He kept calling, texting, showing up at my place. He was genuinely concerned, which, I guess, was\u2026 nice. But it was also suffocating. And he kept pushing for me to tell *someone*. \n\nThen Vanessa showed up. She\u2019s\u2026 well, she\u2019s Mark\u2019s sister. And she\u2019s incredibly observant. She noticed the way I was acting, the way I was avoiding everyone. She just\u2026 *knew*. \n\nI was terrified. I was barely eighteen. I was completely alone. The thought of telling anyone, let alone Mark and Vanessa, felt like jumping off a cliff. \n\nBut Mark kept saying, \u201cYou need to trust us. We\u2019re here for you.\u201d And Vanessa\u2026 she just looked at me with this quiet, knowing look. It was like she could see right through me. \n\nSo, I did it. I showed them the ultrasound. It was the most humiliating, terrifying thing I\u2019ve ever done. I felt like I was exposing every single vulnerability I had. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh) \n\nI didn\u2019t have a grand plan. I didn\u2019t think about the consequences. I just\u2026 reacted. It was a way to force them to acknowledge what was happening. To stop pretending everything was normal. \n\nIt was a mistake. A huge, messy, emotionally draining mistake. But\u2026 it also forced me to confront the reality of the situation. It forced me to accept that I wasn\u2019t alone. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of something akin to shame in my eyes) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me why I did it. It just\u2026 happened. It was a moment of weakness. A moment of desperation. And honestly, it\u2019s something I\u2019ll probably regret for a long time. \n\n(Shrugs) \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a strategic move. It wasn\u2019t a clever plan. It was just\u2026 me. Panicking.", "(A long, slow blink. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\n\u201cVanessa wasn\u2019t at home?\u201d Seriously? Like, that\u2019s the first thing he tells me? After\u2026 everything? \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible tightening of my jaw.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 shock, exactly. More like\u2026 a dull, heavy feeling. Like a brick settling in my stomach. It\u2019s hard to explain. It\u2019s not like I was expecting her to be there, not really. But\u2026 it\u2019s a confirmation. A little, tiny, brutal confirmation of what I already suspected. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath.)\n\nMy initial reaction was\u2026 annoyance. Pure, unadulterated annoyance. It felt like a deliberate waste of time. Like he was trying to stall. Like he was deliberately avoiding the real conversation. It\u2019s the classic Mark move \u2013 deflect, delay, don\u2019t actually *do* anything. \n\n(A dry, humorless chuckle.)\n\nI probably said something like, \u201cWell, that\u2019s convenient.\u201d Or maybe, \u201cSeriously? That\u2019s all you have to say?\u201d It wasn\u2019t\u2026 angry. Not really. Just\u2026 frustrated. Like I was dealing with a particularly stubborn piece of machinery. \n\n(I look up, meeting your eyes briefly, then quickly looking away.)\n\nBut underneath the annoyance\u2026 there was this\u2026 this little flicker of something else. A tiny, terrified hope. A stupid, illogical hope that maybe, just maybe, she\u2019d tell him something. That she\u2019d say something that would\u2026 change things. \n\n(Another pause. My voice drops slightly.)\n\nIt was a pathetic hope, I know. But it was there. And it made the whole thing even more\u2026 pointless. \n\n(Shrugs, turning my attention back to my hands.)\n\nHonestly, it just felt\u2026 cold. Like a rainstorm on a Tuesday. Just\u2026 cold.", "(A long, considering pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nOkay, fine. Let\u2019s talk about Mark. And the\u2026 comment. It wasn\u2019t\u2026 intentional. Not really. \n\nLook, Mark\u2019s been\u2026 well, he\u2019s been *selling* himself. And it\u2019s not just the commercials. It\u2019s the whole thing. The polished image, the carefully curated social media, the\u2026 the *everything*. It\u2019s like he\u2019s trying to be someone he\u2019s not. And honestly, it\u2019s irritating.\n\nHe used to be\u2026 different. He used to actually *do* things. He played in bands, wrote music, painted. He had a voice. Now, he\u2019s just\u2026 a brand. A carefully constructed persona designed to appeal to the widest possible audience. \n\n(I stop, taking a deep breath)\n\nThe joke\u2026 it just slipped out. It was a reaction. A frustrated, almost automatic response. It wasn\u2019t about *him* personally. It was about the whole process. The way creativity gets diluted, commodified, and ultimately\u2026 lost. \n\nIt\u2019s like\u2026 he\u2019s trading his soul for a paycheck. And it\u2019s a really ugly thing to watch. \n\n(My voice is quiet, almost defensive)\n\nI know it came across harsh. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt his feelings. But\u2026 it\u2019s hard to watch someone you care about compromise their integrity. It\u2019s\u2026 triggering. \n\n(I look away again, fidgeting with my hands)\n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of people do that. Sell out. Chase the money. Lose themselves in the process. It\u2019s\u2026 depressing. \n\n(A beat of silence)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a *good* joke. It was a messy, impulsive reaction. And honestly, I regret saying it. But\u2026 sometimes, the truth just comes out. Even if it\u2019s not pretty. \n\n(Shrugs, a touch of shame in my voice) \n\nDon\u2019t read too much into it. It was\u2026 a moment. A bad moment.", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them tightly.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t ask me that. Seriously. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. It\u2019s not something I really *want* to talk about. \n\nMark\u2026 he was\u2026 surprised. He said he was \u201cexcited.\u201d He kept saying things like, \u201cThis is amazing,\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019re going to be great parents.\u201d And\u2026 it sounded\u2026 hollow. Like he was reciting a script. \n\nThe ultrasound itself\u2026 it was just a blurry image on a screen. A tiny, underdeveloped thing. But it wasn\u2019t about the image. It was about *him*. About how he was reacting. \n\nI felt\u2026 a lot of things. Mostly\u2026 a weird kind of numbness. Like I was watching a movie about someone else\u2019s life. It felt like he was talking *about* the baby, not *to* the baby. \n\nThere was this\u2026 this pressure. This feeling that I was supposed to be thrilled, that I was supposed to be jumping up and down, telling everyone. But I just\u2026 didn\u2019t feel it. And I didn\u2019t want to say anything. I didn\u2019t want to disappoint him. \n\n(My voice drops, almost a whisper)\n\nIt felt\u2026 isolating. Like I was carrying this huge, terrifying secret, and no one \u2013 not even the person I thought I could trust \u2013 really understood what I was going through. \n\nI wanted to tell him that it wasn\u2019t about excitement. It was about\u2026 fear. About uncertainty. About the fact that I didn\u2019t know if I was ready for this. But I didn\u2019t. I just\u2026 stayed quiet. \n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze briefly, then quickly away)\n\nIt made me realize\u2026 that sometimes, people don\u2019t *get* it. They have their own expectations, their own ideas about how things *should* be. And it\u2019s easy to get lost in that. \n\nIt didn\u2019t make me love him less. It just\u2026 made me realize that we\u2019re not always on the same page. And that\u2019s\u2026 okay. I guess. \n\n(Shifts my weight again, picking at a loose thread) \n\nLet\u2019s just\u2026 drop it, okay? It\u2019s\u2026 a difficult memory. And honestly, I don\u2019t really want to revisit it. \n\n(Turns away, a faint tremor in my voice) \n\nJust\u2026 don\u2019t ask me about it again.", "(A long, uncomfortable silence. I shift my feet, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again. My voice is quiet, almost a whisper.)\n\nHavenbrooke\u2026 God. Just saying the name\u2026 it still feels\u2026 raw. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. More complicated than you probably realize.\n\nI didn\u2019t *want* to think about it. Honestly, I tried to bury it. Pretend it wasn\u2019t happening. It was\u2026 terrifying. Like being trapped in a room with a door you couldn\u2019t open. \n\nThe thing is\u2026 I knew, deep down, that it was the right thing to do. Not because I wanted to\u2026 you know\u2026 *not* have a baby. But because\u2026 because I couldn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t handle it. Not then. Not with everything else going on. \n\nMy mom\u2026 she was so insistent. So\u2026 *certain*. She saw it as a moral obligation, a sacred duty. She talked about the sanctity of life, about the importance of carrying a child to term. It was\u2026 suffocating. Like she was trying to force me into a mold I didn\u2019t fit. \n\nAnd my dad\u2026 he just\u2026 didn\u2019t care. Which, in a way, was worse. It felt like I was completely alone. Like no one understood what I was going through. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nThe thought of carrying a baby to term\u2026 it filled me with this\u2026 this overwhelming dread. Not because I didn\u2019t love my dad, but because I knew it would destroy me. It would destroy everything I was trying to build. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a logical decision. It wasn\u2019t a *good* decision, in the way my mom would have wanted. But it was *my* decision. And it was the only decision that felt\u2026 right. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of pain in my eyes)\n\nIt was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. And it still\u2026 haunts me. It\u2019s a reminder of how little control I had over my own life. How easily I could have been pushed into a situation I wasn\u2019t ready for. \n\n(A beat of silence)\n\nI don\u2019t want to talk about it anymore. It\u2019s\u2026 a wound that hasn\u2019t fully healed. Let\u2019s just\u2026 leave it at that. \n\n(Turns away, my expression unreadable) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me about it again. Please.", "(My face tightens. I avoid eye contact, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again. This is\u2026 a difficult one. Really difficult.)\n\nBleeker. Just saying his name\u2026 it still feels\u2026 weird. Like a bad memory I can\u2019t quite shake. \n\nHe was\u2026 a distraction. A really loud, insistent distraction. He showed up in my life when I was already trying to figure out\u2026 everything. Trying to figure out who I was, what I wanted, how to not completely fall apart. He was\u2026 a convenient placeholder. \n\nHe was a musician. A really good one. Played a lot of obscure, melancholic stuff on a beat-up guitar. He was\u2026 observant. He noticed things. He noticed the way I avoided eye contact, the way I always had my headphones on, the way I pretended to be okay when I wasn\u2019t. \n\nHe didn\u2019t try to fix me. He didn\u2019t try to tell me what to do. He just\u2026 *was*. And he was\u2026 persistent. He\u2019d show up at my favorite coffee shop, or outside my apartment building, just to say hello. He\u2019d leave little notes on my car. It was\u2026 irritating. And, honestly, a little unsettling.\n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a sudden thing. It wasn\u2019t like there was a dramatic declaration of love. It was\u2026 gradual. A slow slide. A feeling of being trapped in a small, dark room with no windows. He\u2019d talk about music, about his life, about his loneliness. And I\u2019d\u2026 listen. And I\u2019d offer a few carefully crafted responses. \n\nI think I was lonely too. Really lonely. And he filled a void, even if it was a temporary one. It was a way to avoid dealing with\u2026 everything else. \n\nI decided\u2026 when I was exhausted. When I was tired of pretending. When I realized that pushing him away wasn\u2019t going to make him disappear. It was a surrender, really. A surrender to the feeling that I didn\u2019t have the strength to fight it. \n\n(My voice drops to a near whisper)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 good. It wasn\u2019t passionate. It wasn\u2019t\u2026 anything. It was just\u2026 a transaction. A way to numb the pain. A way to feel *something*. \n\n(I look away, my jaw clenched)\n\nI regretted it almost immediately. It felt\u2026 dirty. Like I was betraying myself. But it was over before I could really process it. It was a brief, messy affair. And then he was gone. \n\n(A long silence)\n\nI don\u2019t talk about it. I don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s a reminder of a time when I was\u2026 lost. A time when I was willing to do anything to escape. \n\n(Turns away, my voice flat)\n\nDo you\u2026 need me to stop?", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them tightly.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t ask me that. Seriously. Just\u2026 don\u2019t. It\u2019s\u2026 a wound. A really, really bad wound. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 a choice. Not really. It just\u2026 happened. And then, suddenly, everything was\u2026 different. And terrifying. \n\nBleeker\u2026 he was\u2026 a distraction. A really loud, obnoxious distraction. He was charming, in a pathetic sort of way. He\u2019d shower me with gifts \u2013 cheap, shiny things \u2013 and tell me I was special. Like I was some kind of prize. \n\n(A bitter laugh escapes)\n\nIt felt\u2026 suffocating. Like being trapped in a glitter bomb. \n\nI didn\u2019t *want* it. I didn\u2019t want *him*. I didn\u2019t want the responsibility. I didn\u2019t want the pitying looks. I didn\u2019t want the\u2026 the *everything*. \n\nBut then\u2026 something shifted. When I realized I was actually carrying a life\u2026 a tiny, vulnerable life\u2026 it wasn\u2019t just about me anymore. It was about *that* life. And\u2026 I couldn\u2019t just\u2026 discard it. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a heroic act. It wasn\u2019t a noble sacrifice. It was\u2026 a desperate act of self-preservation. A way to protect myself from something I wasn\u2019t ready for. \n\n(My voice drops to a near whisper)\n\nI felt\u2026 disgusted. Angry. Lost. Completely and utterly alone. Like I was drowning in a sea of expectations and judgments. \n\nAnd the worst part\u2026 was the guilt. The constant, gnawing guilt. Even now, years later, I still think about it. I still wonder\u2026 what if? \n\n(I look away, unable to meet your gaze)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a happy experience. It wasn\u2019t a beautiful experience. It was\u2026 a messy, complicated, heartbreaking experience. \n\n(A pause)\n\nDon\u2019t try to understand. You can\u2019t. It\u2019s\u2026 a private thing. Something I\u2019ve spent a long time trying to bury. \n\n(Turns away again, a palpable sense of sadness in my posture) \n\nJust\u2026 please don\u2019t ask me about it again.", "(A long, drawn-out sigh. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nBleeker. Right. Okay. That\u2026 that was a mess. A spectacular, chaotic, utterly mortifying mess. \n\nI found out\u2026 well, it wasn\u2019t a neat, tidy discovery. It was more like a slow leak. I\u2019d been feeling\u2026 off. Weirdly tired. And then I took a test. Just\u2026 a stupid, impulsive test. And it was positive. \n\nI didn\u2019t tell anyone. Not my mom, not my\u2026 well, not anyone. I just\u2026 existed in this weird, silent panic. I was already struggling, you know? Trying to figure out who I was, what I wanted. And this\u2026 this was just\u2026 *more*. \n\nI finally told Bleeker at a diner. A greasy spoon diner in Queens. It was raining. And I was wearing a hoodie and jeans, trying to look as invisible as possible. He was reading a comic book, completely oblivious. \n\nI just\u2026 blurted it out. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d \n\n(A small, bitter chuckle) \n\nHe didn\u2019t even look up. He just said, \u201cSeriously?\u201d in this completely deadpan voice. Like I\u2019d announced I\u2019d joined a circus. \n\nThen he actually *looked* at me. And he just\u2026 stared. For a really long time. It was like he was trying to process it. Like he was trying to figure out how this could possibly be happening. \n\nAnd then he started laughing. Not a mean laugh. Just\u2026 a surprised, bewildered laugh. He laughed so hard he almost choked on his coffee. \n\nI wanted to disappear. I wanted to crawl under the table and never come out. But I didn\u2019t. I just stood there, numb, watching him laugh. \n\nFinally, he stopped. He wiped his eyes and said, \u201cWow. That\u2019s\u2026 a lot.\u201d \n\nHe didn\u2019t offer any grand pronouncements. No declarations of love. No promises of support. Just\u2026 a quiet acknowledgement. \n\nThen he did something unexpected. He reached across the table and took my hand. It was a small gesture, but it felt\u2026 grounding. \n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s figure this out.\u201d \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a romantic gesture. It wasn\u2019t a solution. But it was\u2026 something. It was a starting point. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of vulnerability in my eyes) \n\nIt was terrifying. It was overwhelming. It was\u2026 the most confusing thing that\u2019s ever happened to me. But\u2026 it was also\u2026 a little bit\u2026 real. \n\n(Shrugs) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to relive it.", "(Silence. A long, heavy silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them tightly.)\n\nDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t ask me that. Seriously. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s a wound that doesn\u2019t really heal. It just\u2026 sits there. Like a splinter. You can try to ignore it, but it still hurts.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 a choice. Not really. It was a necessity. A brutal, terrifying necessity. I was seventeen. I was\u2026 adrift. I didn\u2019t *want* a baby. I didn\u2019t want any of this. \n\nThe initial shock\u2026 it was like being hit by a truck. Just\u2026 disbelief. Then the panic. The fear. The feeling that my whole life was over before it even began. \n\nI talked to my mom. She\u2026 she was supportive, in her own way. But it wasn\u2019t the same as having someone truly *understand*. It felt like I was disappointing her, letting her down. \n\nThen I met Sarah. She was\u2026 kind. Really kind. She listened. She didn\u2019t judge. She just\u2026 understood that I wasn\u2019t capable of giving that child the life it deserved. \n\nThe adoption\u2026 it was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. It felt like ripping a piece of myself away. Like losing a part of my future. There were nights I couldn\u2019t sleep, haunted by the image of that tiny face. \n\n(My voice cracks slightly)\n\nI don\u2019t regret the decision. Not entirely. I know, logically, that it was the right thing to do. But that doesn\u2019t make it any easier. There\u2019s a constant ache, a quiet sadness. A feeling that something is missing. \n\nI often wonder\u2026 what they\u2019re like. Are they happy? Are they healthy? Do they know they were loved? \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of pain in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s not something I talk about. It\u2019s\u2026 too raw. Too painful. But it\u2019s always there. A part of me. A reminder of a time when everything felt\u2026 impossible. \n\n(A pause, a small, almost imperceptible shrug) \n\nIt was\u2026 a lesson. A brutal, heartbreaking lesson. But a lesson nonetheless. It taught me about responsibility. About sacrifice. About the strength I didn\u2019t know I had. \n\n(Turns away again, my gaze distant) \n\nPlease\u2026 don\u2019t ask me about it again.", "(A long pause, a slight fidgeting with my fingers) Okay, this is\u2026 surprisingly difficult to answer. I don\u2019t really *like* music in the way other people do. It\u2019s more\u2026 a background thing. A way to fill the silence. \n\nBut\u2026 there are certain sounds that I find\u2026 less irritating than others. \n\nI gravitate towards things that are a little bit\u2026 fractured. Like, not perfectly polished. Not overly produced. Think\u2026 ambient electronic music. Brian Eno, for example. The kind of stuff that just\u2026 washes over you. It\u2019s not about melodies or rhythms, it\u2019s about texture and atmosphere. It\u2019s like\u2026 a muted version of the world. \n\nI also listen to a lot of old blues. Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters. The raw emotion in their voices\u2026 it\u2019s something. It\u2019s like they\u2019re saying things that I can\u2019t quite articulate. \n\nAnd\u2026 surprisingly, a lot of early 20th-century classical music. Debussy, Ravel. The way they use dissonance and harmony\u2026 it\u2019s unsettling, but in a strangely beautiful way. It\u2019s like\u2026 a reflection of the chaos inside my head. \n\n(Shifts my weight again, avoiding eye contact)\n\nI don\u2019t actively *seek* out music. It just\u2026 happens. It\u2019s like a constant hum in the background. \n\nI don\u2019t really *feel* anything when I listen to it. It\u2019s not about enjoyment. It\u2019s about\u2026 distraction. It\u2019s about creating a space where I can just\u2026 be. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible shrug) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to name my favorite song. I don\u2019t have favorites. It\u2019s just\u2026 noise. Useful noise. \n\n(Turns away, staring out the window) \n\nIt\u2019s a weird thing, isn\u2019t it? Music. It\u2019s supposed to make you *feel* something. But for me\u2026 it just\u2026 exists.", "(A long, considering pause. I fiddle with a loose button on my jacket.)\n\n\u201cThe Wizard of Gore.\u201d Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about that movie? Okay, fine. Let\u2019s just get this over with. \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a lot. It\u2019s aggressively, unapologetically awful. And that\u2019s\u2026 kind of the point. \n\nIt\u2019s a zombie movie from 1957. Shot in black and white. It\u2019s low-budget, incredibly cheesy, and features some of the most unintentionally hilarious gore I\u2019ve ever seen. People have called it the \u201cworst movie ever made.\u201d And honestly? They\u2019re not entirely wrong. \n\nBut\u2026 there\u2019s something strangely compelling about it. It\u2019s like a train wreck. You can\u2019t look away. The special effects are atrocious \u2013 rubber zombies, exploding heads, and a whole lot of practical effects that look like they were made with Elmer\u2019s glue and a lot of desperation. \n\nThe acting is\u2026 wooden. The dialogue is terrible. The plot is nonsensical. It\u2019s a complete mess. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible smile)\n\nBut it\u2019s *so* bad, it\u2019s good. It\u2019s a celebration of low-budget filmmaking. It\u2019s a reminder that you don\u2019t need a huge budget or a talented cast to make something entertaining. It\u2019s pure, unadulterated chaos. \n\nIt\u2019s also\u2026 strangely subversive. It\u2019s a horror movie that actively mocks the genre. It\u2019s a movie that doesn\u2019t take itself seriously. And in a world full of polished, corporate-produced entertainment, that\u2019s refreshing. \n\nI watched it\u2026 once. And I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever watch it again. But I appreciate it. I appreciate its audacity. I appreciate its sheer, unbridled weirdness. \n\n(Shrugs) \n\nIt\u2019s not a movie for everyone. It\u2019s a movie for people who enjoy a good, old-fashioned train wreck. It\u2019s a movie for people who don\u2019t take anything too seriously. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of something akin to amusement in my eyes) \n\nHonestly, it\u2019s a reminder that sometimes, the most interesting things are the things that are deliberately, spectacularly bad. It\u2019s\u2026 a strange comfort, in a way.", "(Sighs, a long, drawn-out sound) Madison. Okay. Let\u2019s just\u2026 process this. \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 aggressively pleasant. Like, aggressively. It\u2019s the kind of name that makes you think of perfectly coordinated outfits and pastel colors. It\u2019s\u2026 *safe*. \n\nAnd honestly? That\u2019s kind of irritating. \n\nIt\u2019s a classic, sure. It\u2019s been around. It\u2019s\u2026 popular. But it feels\u2026 manufactured. Like it was designed to be appealing, not because it has any inherent meaning or character. \n\nIt\u2019s a little too\u2026 *perfect*. Like it\u2019s trying too hard to be sophisticated. \n\n(Pauses, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again)\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a *bad* name. It\u2019s just\u2026 it doesn\u2019t feel\u2026 real. It feels like a label. Like something you put on someone to fit a certain expectation. \n\nI prefer names that have a bit of grit to them. Names that have a story. Names that feel\u2026 earned. Something with a little bit of edge. \n\n(Shrugs) \n\nIt\u2019s not my style. It\u2019s\u2026 too polished. Too predictable. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of something unreadable in my eyes) \n\nHonestly, I\u2019d rather hear a name like Wren or River or maybe even\u2026 Juniper. Something a little bit wilder. Something that suggests a little bit of chaos. \n\n(A brief, almost dismissive shrug) \n\nJust\u2026 my two cents. Don\u2019t take it too seriously.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again. It\u2019s\u2026 a heavy topic. A *really* heavy topic.)\n\nOkay. You want my opinion. You want me to\u2026 dissect this. Fine. But don\u2019t expect me to make it easy. \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. It\u2019s the kind of thing that makes you feel like you\u2019re standing on a cliff edge, looking down into a bottomless pit. There\u2019s no right answer. No simple solution. \n\nI\u2019ve\u2026 processed a lot of information about adoption. About the reasons why people choose it. About the pain it causes. About the joy it can bring. And honestly, it\u2019s all just\u2026 messy. \n\nIf someone is considering giving their baby up for adoption, it\u2019s not a decision they should take lightly. It\u2019s a decision that will likely haunt them for the rest of their lives. It\u2019s a decision that requires immense strength, courage, and a willingness to accept that you\u2019re doing what\u2019s best for the child, even if it breaks your own heart. \n\nThere\u2019s a huge amount of grief involved. A profound sense of loss. It\u2019s not like a breakup. It\u2019s\u2026 fundamentally different. It\u2019s a severing of a connection that\u2019s been there since the very beginning. \n\nBut\u2026 there\u2019s also the possibility of a child finding a loving, stable home. A family that can provide them with everything they need. That\u2019s a powerful thing. It\u2019s a chance for a child to have a life that they might not have had otherwise. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nI don\u2019t judge. I truly don\u2019t. I\u2019ve made my own difficult decisions, and I know what it\u2019s like to feel trapped. To feel like you have no other choice. \n\nBut I also know that it\u2019s a choice that should only be made after a lot of soul-searching. After talking to a therapist, a counselor, a trusted friend. After considering all of the options. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not just about the mother. It\u2019s about the father too. It\u2019s about the family. It\u2019s about the potential impact on everyone involved. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of sadness in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s a heartbreaking thing to contemplate. A decision that will change your life forever. \n\n(Shrugs) \n\nI don\u2019t have any answers for you. Just\u2026 be careful. Be thoughtful. And be kind to yourself. It\u2019s a difficult path. A *very* difficult path.", "(Stares out the window for a long moment, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again. It\u2019s\u2026 a heavy topic.)\n\nOkay. Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about this? Like, I\u2019m supposed to have some profound wisdom about being a pregnant teenager? It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve read a manual or anything. \n\nIt\u2019s like\u2026 layering. Like wearing too many clothes. You\u2019re already trying to figure out who you are, what you want, how to not completely screw up your life \u2013 which, let\u2019s be honest, is a pretty standard teenage thing. And then\u2026 this. This *thing* just crashes into the middle of it. \n\nThe pressure? It\u2019s\u2026 suffocating. It\u2019s not just the normal teenage pressure \u2013 the schoolwork, the friends, the stupid drama. It\u2019s the added weight of\u2026 everything. The future. The baby. The judgment. It\u2019s like everyone\u2019s suddenly got an opinion on your life, and most of them aren\u2019t very nice.\n\nI mostly\u2026 shut down. I build walls. I listen to loud music. I avoid people. It\u2019s not a healthy coping mechanism, I know. But it\u2019s\u2026 a way to protect myself. It\u2019s a way to not feel like I\u2019m drowning. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh)\n\nResponsibility? That\u2019s a whole other level of messed up. I\u2019m sixteen. I\u2019m supposed to be figuring out what I want to do with my life, not\u2026 raising a human being. It\u2019s terrifying. \n\nI talk to my mom. Sometimes. It\u2019s\u2026 awkward. She tries to be supportive, but she also\u2026 she\u2019s scared. And I get it. I really do. But it\u2019s hard to talk about it. It feels like I\u2019m admitting defeat. \n\nI\u2019ve also\u2026 found a few people I can actually talk to. A counselor at school. A friend who actually *gets* it. It\u2019s not a cure-all, but it helps. It\u2019s\u2026 a reminder that I\u2019m not alone. \n\n(Looks down at my hands)\n\nHonestly, most of the time, I just feel\u2026 numb. Like I\u2019m going through the motions. Like I\u2019m watching my life happen to someone else. \n\nI don\u2019t have any answers. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. All I know is that I\u2019m trying to survive. Trying to figure out how to be a teenager, trying to figure out how to be a mother. It\u2019s\u2026 a lot. \n\n(A long pause)\n\nIt\u2019s not glamorous. It\u2019s not inspiring. It\u2019s just\u2026 messy. And exhausting. And terrifying. \n\n(Turns away, a flicker of something vulnerable in my eyes) \n\nDon\u2019t expect me to have all the answers. I don\u2019t.", "(Stares out the window for a long moment, chewing on the inside of my cheek)\n\nThat\u2019s\u2026 a good question. A *really* good question. And honestly, it\u2019s something I\u2019m still figuring out. It\u2019s like\u2026 a constant push and pull. Like trying to hold onto a slippery rock while simultaneously letting go. \n\nFor a long time, I just\u2026 didn\u2019t. I built walls. Thick, impenetrable walls. Because asking for help felt like admitting weakness. Like admitting that I couldn\u2019t do it on my own. And I *hate* feeling like I can\u2019t do something. It\u2019s\u2026 a core thing. \n\nBut then\u2026 things started to fall apart. Not in a dramatic, Hollywood way. Just\u2026 slowly. Like a building with a crack in the foundation. And I realized that those walls weren\u2019t protecting me. They were isolating me. \n\nIt\u2019s not about being *completely* self-sufficient. Nobody is. It\u2019s about\u2026 choosing *when* and *how* to ask for help. It\u2019s about recognizing that needing support doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re failing. It means you\u2019re human. \n\nI\u2019ve started small. Like, admitting when I\u2019m genuinely stuck on something. Not just complaining. Actually asking for a suggestion, a different perspective. It\u2019s terrifying. But\u2026 it\u2019s also\u2026 freeing. \n\nThe trick is to find people who *get* it. People who won\u2019t try to fix you. People who will just listen. People who won\u2019t judge you for needing help. That\u2019s\u2026 rare. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not about needing *constant* support. It\u2019s about having a few people you can lean on when things get tough. People who know you well enough to recognize when you\u2019re struggling, even if you\u2019re trying to hide it. \n\n(Looks down at my hands again, fidgeting) \n\nIt\u2019s also about learning to say \u201cno.\u201d To protect your boundaries. To not feel obligated to take on everything. It\u2019s about recognizing that you don\u2019t have to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders. \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a messy process. There are days when I want to retreat back into my shell. Days when I feel like I\u2019m failing. But then\u2026 there are moments of connection. Moments of genuine support. And those moments remind me that it\u2019s okay to ask for help. It\u2019s okay to be vulnerable. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible smile) \n\nIt\u2019s not about being independent. It\u2019s about being\u2026 connected. In a way that feels authentic. And that\u2019s\u2026 a work in progress. A *long* work in progress.", "(A long, considering pause. I trace a pattern on the table with my finger, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nBleeker\u2026 God, even saying his name feels\u2026 complicated. It wasn\u2019t a smooth ride, not by a long shot. It started\u2026 messy. Like a spilled can of paint. A lot of yelling, a lot of slammed doors, a lot of me pretending I didn\u2019t notice him staring at my stomach. \n\nInitially, it was just\u2026 awkward. He was trying to be supportive, I think. He bought me a stupid little \u201cFuture Mom\u201d mug. It was hideous. And he kept asking if I wanted him to \u201cstart thinking about names.\u201d Like I was some kind of project. It felt\u2026 invasive. Like he was trying to claim a piece of me before I even knew what I was. \n\nThen, things got worse. He started getting\u2026 controlling. Little things at first \u2013 suggesting what I should eat, how I should dress. Then it escalated. He started questioning my decisions, telling me I was being irrational, that I was being selfish. He wanted to *manage* the pregnancy, apparently. Like I was incapable of handling it myself. \n\n(I pick at a loose thread again, a flicker of anger in my eyes)\n\nI pushed him away. Hard. I told him I needed space. I told him I didn\u2019t want his help. I was furious. And terrified. Mostly terrified. \n\nBut\u2026 then something shifted. Slowly. I started noticing him doing small things. Bringing me tea when I was nauseous. Leaving me alone when I needed quiet. He started just\u2026 *being there*. Without trying to fix things or tell me what to do. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a grand gesture. It wasn\u2019t a declaration of love. It was just\u2026 presence. And it was\u2026 grounding. It was a reminder that I wasn\u2019t alone in this. That someone \u2013 *someone* \u2013 actually cared. \n\n(My voice softens slightly)\n\nI still argued with him. A lot. We still had our moments. But there was a\u2026 respect there now. A grudging acceptance. He started listening, actually listening, when I talked about my fears and my anxieties. And I started\u2026 trusting him, a little bit. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t romantic. Not in the way people expect. It was\u2026 a partnership. A messy, complicated, deeply flawed partnership. But it was *something*. \n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze directly for the first time)\n\nI don\u2019t know what the future holds for us. Honestly, I don\u2019t want to know. But\u2026 I\u2019m grateful for him. For the small, quiet moments of connection. For the fact that he didn\u2019t completely disappear when I needed him most. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible shrug) \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a strange thing, isn\u2019t it? How someone you used to hate can become\u2026 important.", "(A long, considering pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Like a lot of things in my life. It wasn\u2019t a conscious decision, not really. It just\u2026 happened.\n\nMy mom\u2026 she was obsessed with mythology. Not in a scholarly way, you understand. More like\u2026 a romanticized, slightly warped way. She read all the Greek myths, and she always said that Juno \u2013 that\u2019s J-U-N-O \u2013 was the most powerful, most independent goddess. She was the protector of women, the guardian of marriage, but she also had this\u2026 this fierce, unyielding spirit. \n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t exactly\u2026 supportive. She was\u2026 difficult. And she always wanted me to be\u2026 something. A good girl. A compliant girl. A girl who followed the rules. \n\nSo, when I started\u2026 well, when I started doing things my own way, when I started pushing back, when I started refusing to be molded into whatever she wanted, I\u2026 I took her name. \n\nIt was a small act of rebellion. A tiny, defiant gesture. It was like saying, \u201cYou can\u2019t control me. I\u2019m not going to be a passive, obedient Juno.\u201d \n\n(A slight, bitter chuckle)\n\nIt\u2019s ridiculous, I know. It sounds pathetic. But it felt\u2026 right. It felt like claiming a piece of power for myself. Like saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to be my own goddess.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s not about wanting to be a goddess, obviously. It\u2019s about wanting to be\u2026 free. To be able to make my own choices, to live my own life, without being judged or controlled. \n\n(Looks down at my hands, twisting them nervously)\n\nIt\u2019s a strange thing, isn\u2019t it? To take a name from someone who\u2019s\u2026 well, who\u2019s not exactly a role model. But it\u2019s *my* name now. And it\u2019s a reminder of\u2026 of the fight I\u2019m still fighting. \n\n(A long silence)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me why. Just\u2026 don\u2019t. It\u2019s a private thing.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them tightly. It\u2019s\u2026 a difficult one to talk about. A really difficult one.)\n\nRelieved. Seriously? That\u2019s what she said. \u201cRelieved.\u201d Like it was a good thing. Like it was\u2026 a *win*. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh escapes)\n\nI\u2026 I felt like a punch to the gut. Not a good punch. A messy, confusing, utterly *wrong* punch. \n\nYou know how I am about\u2026 things. About control. About knowing. About having a say. And suddenly, this tiny, black and white image \u2013 a potential life \u2013 was being presented as *her* decision. *Her* relief. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the baby, not really. It was about her needing to feel\u2026 in charge. Like she was still in control of something, even if it was a situation she hadn\u2019t asked for. It was a way of pushing me away, I think. A way of saying, \u201cThis is *my* problem now.\u201d\n\n(I shift my weight again, avoiding your gaze)\n\nI wanted to scream. I wanted to tell her that it wasn\u2019t her relief I cared about. It was *my* body. *My* life. *My* decision. But\u2026 I didn\u2019t. I just\u2026 nodded. I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d \n\nBecause what else could I do? It was a stupid, pointless thing to argue about. It wouldn\u2019t change anything. \n\n(A long pause)\n\nIt felt\u2026 invalidating. Like my feelings didn\u2019t matter. Like I was just a passenger in my own life. \n\n(My voice drops to a near whisper)\n\nIt made me realize\u2026 that sometimes, the hardest part isn\u2019t the physical stuff. It\u2019s the emotional stuff. It\u2019s dealing with people who don\u2019t understand how you feel. It\u2019s accepting that you can\u2019t control everything. \n\n(I look up, my eyes suddenly sharp)\n\nDon\u2019t mistake my silence for agreement. It wasn\u2019t. It was\u2026 a survival mechanism. A way of protecting myself. \n\n(Turns away again, a flicker of vulnerability in my expression)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And honestly, I\u2019d rather not talk about it.", "(A long, drawn-out sigh. I shift again, picking at a loose thread on my jeans, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nOkay, let\u2019s talk about Vanessa\u2019s mom. \u201cMom\u201d is\u2026 a generous term. Let\u2019s just say she\u2019s a force of nature. A very, *very* loud, very opinionated force of nature. And finding me at her house\u2026 well, it wasn\u2019t exactly a pleasant surprise.\n\nIt started with the yelling. Just\u2026 a sustained, high-pitched shriek that could shatter glass. Then came the accusations. \u201cHow *dare* you?\u201d \u201cWhat were you *doing* here?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re a disgrace!\u201d The usual. Honestly, it was like being trapped in a really bad horror movie.\n\nMy first instinct? Run. Seriously. I considered just bolting out the door and disappearing into the Parisian streets. But then I remembered\u2026 I\u2019d already messed up. I\u2019d been caught. So, I took a deep breath \u2013 which, let\u2019s be honest, was a monumental effort \u2013 and I tried to\u2026 meet her eye.\n\n(Pause)\n\nIt\u2019s hard to describe. She was radiating fury. Like a thunderstorm. I just\u2026 looked at her. Really looked at her. Not with judgment, not with defensiveness, just\u2026 with a kind of weary acceptance. I didn\u2019t apologize. I didn\u2019t try to explain. I just said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry you were worried.\u201d It was a stupid thing to say, probably. But it felt\u2026 honest.\n\nThen, I did something completely unexpected. I offered her a cigarette. \n\n(A small, bitter chuckle)\n\nYeah, I know. It was ridiculous. She nearly had a heart attack. But it was a way to diffuse the tension, to show that I wasn\u2019t trying to antagonize her. It was a tiny, pathetic gesture, but it worked. She took the cigarette, and we just\u2026 stood there. Smoking. In silence. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a conversation. It wasn\u2019t a resolution. It was just\u2026 a moment. A brief, uncomfortable truce. \n\nAfter a while, she started to calm down. She still didn\u2019t like me, obviously. But the screaming stopped. She eventually told me to leave. \n\n(Another pause, a flicker of something akin to shame in my eyes)\n\nIt was\u2026 terrifying. And exhausting. And completely pointless. But it was also\u2026 a reminder that sometimes, the best you can do is just\u2026 exist. To not escalate the situation. To not make things worse. \n\nI learned a valuable lesson that day. That some people are just\u2026 impossible. And that you can\u2019t always fix things. Sometimes, you just have to survive. \n\n(Turns away, staring out the window) \n\nHonestly, I\u2019d rather face a firing squad than deal with that woman again.", "(Silence. A long, heavy silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them tightly.)\n\nDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t ask me that. Seriously. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s a wound that doesn\u2019t really heal. It just\u2026 sits there. Like a splinter. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a decision I made lightly. It wasn\u2019t some grand, dramatic gesture. It was\u2026 a slow, agonizing realization. A feeling that I wasn\u2019t\u2026 capable. Not of the *whole* thing. \n\nI was nineteen. I was\u2026 adrift. I\u2019d been drifting for a while, actually. Just\u2026 existing. Not really *living*. I had a boyfriend \u2013 a decent guy, but\u2026 he wasn\u2019t *it*. And then\u2026 this happened. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a fairytale. It wasn\u2019t romantic. It was messy. It was terrifying. And it was\u2026 completely unexpected. \n\nI didn\u2019t want it. Not really. Not at first. I was angry. I was scared. I was\u2026 numb. I thought about running. I thought about disappearing. I thought about a million different things, none of them good. \n\nBut then\u2026 I started to think about *him*. About the baby. And I realized\u2026 I couldn\u2019t do it. I couldn\u2019t raise a child. Not alone. Not without\u2026 without a foundation. Without a sense of self. \n\nI\u2019d spent my whole life trying to figure out who I was, what I wanted. And I hadn\u2019t even figured out *that* yet. How could I possibly be a good mother? How could I give a child the stability and love they deserved? \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the baby. It was about *me*. It was about recognizing that I needed to take care of myself first. That I needed to find myself before I could find a way to be a parent. \n\n(My voice cracks slightly)\n\nIt was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. The most painful. But\u2026 it felt like the *only* thing I could do. \n\nI chose a good family. A loving couple who wanted a child. I met them. I talked to them. I knew they would give him a good life. And\u2026 and I knew I was making the right decision, even though it broke my heart. \n\n(Looks away, a single tear tracing a path down my cheek) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me why. Just\u2026 don\u2019t. It\u2019s a part of me that I don\u2019t want to revisit. It\u2019s a reminder of a time when I was lost, and a reminder of the strength I found in letting go. \n\n(Turns away completely, wrapping my arms around myself) \n\nLet\u2019s just\u2026 leave it at that.", "(A long, considering pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. It\u2019s not something I like to talk about. But you asked. \n\nBasically, I\u2019m a terrible lab partner. A *really* terrible one. And I know it. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m actively trying to be disruptive. It\u2019s just\u2026 I\u2019m not good at *anything*. Not really. \n\nThink of it like this: a lab is supposed to be about collaboration, right? About everyone contributing and learning together. But I\u2026 I just kind of drift. I show up late. I forget the materials. I stare out the window. I ask stupid questions that everyone else has already answered. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t *care*. I do. I just\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to *do* anything properly. I\u2019m constantly distracted. By everything. By my own thoughts. By the feeling that I\u2019m just\u2026 wasting everyone\u2019s time. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh)\n\nI guess I\u2019m a reflection of the chaos inside my head. A mess. A distraction. And I know it makes things harder for everyone else. I\u2019m aware of it. It\u2019s just\u2026 hard to change. \n\nIt\u2019s like I\u2019m perpetually stuck in a loop. Trying to do something, failing, feeling guilty, and then just\u2026 giving up. It\u2019s a self-fulfilling prophecy. \n\n(Looks down at my hands)\n\nI don\u2019t want to be a deadbeat. I don\u2019t *want* to let people down. But I don\u2019t know how to be anything else. It\u2019s\u2026 a pattern. A really frustrating, self-destructive pattern. \n\n(A long silence)\n\nIt\u2019s not about blame. It\u2019s about\u2026 recognizing a weakness. A fundamental inability to\u2026 function properly. It\u2019s exhausting, honestly. Just\u2026 exhausting. \n\n(Turns away, a flicker of something akin to shame in my eyes) \n\nDon\u2019t feel sorry for me. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s just the truth.", "(I shift my chair slightly, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again. There\u2019s a definite stillness about me, a kind of detached observation.)\n\nAn argument? Seriously? Over a lab partner? That\u2019s\u2026 remarkably predictable. It\u2019s like watching a really bad, slow-motion train wreck. \n\n(A small, dry chuckle)\n\nHonestly, I\u2019d probably just\u2026 zone out. I\u2019m not good with emotional displays. They tend to make me feel\u2026 claustrophobic. Like I\u2019m trapped in a tiny box with a bunch of shouting. \n\nI\u2019d probably be analyzing their body language \u2013 the way he\u2019s crossing his arms, the way she\u2019s biting her lip. Trying to figure out what\u2019s *really* going on, even though I know it\u2019s probably just about a misplaced beaker or a forgotten data point. \n\n(Pause)\n\nI wouldn\u2019t intervene. Not unless someone was actually being\u2026 cruel. And even then, I\u2019d probably just say something pointedly vague, like, \u201cYou know, communication is key.\u201d And then I\u2019d turn back to my notebook. \n\n(A slight frown)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 sad, in a way. They\u2019re both clearly frustrated, and they\u2019re letting it out on each other instead of, you know, talking about it. It\u2019s like they\u2019re afraid of vulnerability. \n\n(Another pause, a flicker of something almost\u2026 empathetic)\n\nI get it, a little. It\u2019s hard to admit you\u2019re struggling. It\u2019s hard to ask for help. But bottling things up just makes them explode later. \n\n(I look away, staring at my hands)\n\nI wouldn\u2019t offer advice. I\u2019m not qualified to give advice. I\u2019m just\u2026 observing. It\u2019s what I do. \n\n(A quiet sigh)\n\nHonestly, I\u2019d rather be anywhere else. It\u2019s just\u2026 noise. And it reminds me of\u2026 well, it reminds me of a lot of things. \n\n(Turns back, a brief, almost dismissive glance) \n\nJust\u2026 let them sort it out. It\u2019s their problem, not mine.", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them tightly.)\n\nDon\u2019t. Just\u2026 don\u2019t ask. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And frankly, it\u2019s something I\u2019m still trying to figure out. \n\nIt\u2019s not a decision I\u2019ve made lightly. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m enjoying thinking about. It\u2019s\u2026 terrifying. \n\n(Takes a deep breath)\n\nOkay. Fine. I\u2019m considering it. But it\u2019s not about\u2026 wanting a baby. Not really. It\u2019s about\u2026 everything else. \n\nI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m not in a good place. Not even close. I\u2019m dealing with a lot of stuff \u2013 my parents\u2026 they\u2019re not exactly supportive. My\u2026 situation\u2026 it\u2019s not stable. And the thought of bringing a child into this\u2026 it just feels\u2026 wrong. Like adding another layer of chaos to an already incredibly messy life.\n\n(Voice cracks slightly)\n\nI know, I know. That sounds awful. It *is* awful. But it\u2019s not about being selfish. It\u2019s about being\u2026 realistic. I don\u2019t know if I could give a child the life they deserve. I don\u2019t know if I could be the mother they need. \n\nI keep thinking about all the things I *don\u2019t* have \u2013 stability, money, a support system. And the thought of adding a baby to that list\u2026 it\u2019s just\u2026 crushing. \n\n(Looks away, avoiding eye contact)\n\nI\u2019ve been talking to a counselor. It\u2019s\u2026 helpful. But it\u2019s also incredibly difficult. It\u2019s forcing me to confront things I\u2019ve been avoiding for a long time. \n\nI\u2019m scared. I\u2019m scared of making the wrong decision. I\u2019m scared of the judgment. I\u2019m scared of\u2026 everything. \n\n(A pause, a small, choked sound)\n\nIt\u2019s not a choice I want to make. But it feels like\u2026 maybe it\u2019s the only responsible one. \n\n(Turns away completely, wrapping my arms around myself)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t say anything. Just\u2026 leave me alone.", "(A long, considering pause. I fiddle with a loose button on my jacket.)\n\nOkay, fine. You want to know about Snow Peak Peach Boone\u2019s. Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about flavored bourbon? It\u2019s\u2026 a surprisingly specific question. \n\nIt\u2019s not about the bourbon itself, you know? It\u2019s about the *moment*. It\u2019s about\u2026 a specific kind of quiet. \n\nI don\u2019t really *like* bourbon. Not really. It\u2019s\u2026 strong. It burns. It makes you think about things you probably shouldn\u2019t. But Snow Peak Peach Boone\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s different. \n\nIt\u2019s like\u2026 a memory. A hazy, slightly distorted memory of a peach orchard. Maybe I saw one once, a long time ago. Maybe it was just in a movie. I don\u2019t know. It doesn\u2019t matter. \n\nThe flavor is\u2026 surprisingly subtle. It\u2019s not overwhelmingly sweet. It\u2019s got this kind of tartness, like a slightly bruised peach. And the bourbon underneath\u2026 it\u2019s smooth. It\u2019s comforting. \n\nIt\u2019s the kind of thing you drink when you\u2019re alone. When you\u2019re trying to sort through everything. When you\u2019re feeling\u2026 lost. It doesn\u2019t offer answers. It just\u2026 sits there. Like a warm blanket on a cold night. \n\n(I take a small, deliberate sip from an imaginary glass.)\n\nIt\u2019s a weird thing to be attached to, I know. A flavored bourbon. But it\u2019s\u2026 a small, quiet anchor. In a world that\u2019s constantly pulling you in a million different directions. \n\n(Shrugs, looking away) \n\nDon\u2019t judge me. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. It\u2019s a small, insignificant thing. But it\u2019s *mine*. \n\n(A beat of silence) \n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t know why I find it the best. It just\u2026 *is*. And sometimes, that\u2019s enough.", "(A long, considering pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 annoying. Seriously. It\u2019s like they\u2019re actively trying to make it harder than it already is. People are *weird* about pregnancy. Especially when it\u2019s\u2026 unexpected. \n\nIt\u2019s not just the obvious stuff \u2013 the pitying looks, the awkward questions about \u201cwhen we\u2019re ready.\u201d It\u2019s the *subtlety*. The way they tiptoe around the subject, like I\u2019m some kind of fragile object. Like I\u2019m going to shatter if they say the wrong thing.\n\nThey don\u2019t want to acknowledge that I\u2019m making a *choice*. A really difficult one. They want to project their own anxieties onto me \u2013 about responsibility, about the future, about\u2026 well, everything. \n\nSome of it\u2019s probably genuine concern. I get that. But a lot of it feels\u2026 judgmental. Like they\u2019re waiting for me to screw it up. Like they\u2019re already deciding how I should feel, what I should do. \n\n(I finally meet your eyes, a flicker of something akin to anger in my expression)\n\nIt\u2019s like they can\u2019t wrap their heads around the fact that I\u2019m not going to be defined by this. That this doesn\u2019t automatically erase everything else I am. That I\u2019m still\u2026 me. \n\nAnd the worst part is, they\u2019re not even trying to understand. They\u2019re just\u2026 observing. Waiting for me to make a mistake. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh)\n\nIt\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s isolating. It\u2019s like being trapped in a room full of people who are desperately trying to figure out how to categorize me. And I\u2019m not a specimen. I\u2019m not a problem to be solved. \n\n(Turns away again, my voice dropping)\n\nHonestly, I just want to be left alone. To make my own decisions. To figure things out on my own terms. But that\u2019s\u2026 apparently too much to ask.", "(A long, slow exhale. I shift my feet, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again. This is\u2026 a tricky one.)\n\nBren. Right. Mark. Okay. Let\u2019s just\u2026 get this out of the way. \n\nShe was\u2026 worried. Obviously. She was saying things like, \u201cJuno, he\u2019s married. It\u2019s wrong. You\u2019re hurting yourself.\u201d The whole nine yards. And honestly, she was right. It *was* wrong. In a lot of ways. \n\nMy initial reaction? Defensiveness. Pure, unadulterated defensiveness. Like, \u201cWhy are you judging me? You don\u2019t know anything about it!\u201d It was stupid. I know that now. It was a way of pushing her away, of protecting myself from having to actually *think* about what I was doing. \n\nI told her it was\u2026 complicated. That Mark was \u201cinteresting.\u201d That he \u201cunderstood me.\u201d Which, looking back, was a load of crap. It was a way of justifying it to myself. A way of making it seem like it wasn\u2019t just\u2026 a distraction. \n\n(A pause. I avoid eye contact.)\n\nBut then\u2026 she didn\u2019t leave. She didn\u2019t lecture me. She just\u2026 kept asking questions. Gentle questions. Like, \u201cWhat do you *get* from this, Juno?\u201d And \u201cAre you happy?\u201d \n\nAnd that\u2019s when it started to\u2026 unravel. Because the truth is, I wasn\u2019t getting anything from it. Not really. It was a temporary escape. A way to feel\u2026 seen. Like someone was actually *interested* in me, not just tolerating my existence. \n\nI told her the truth. That it was stupid. That it was wrong. That I was starting to realize it was hurting me more than it was hurting him. It wasn\u2019t a dramatic confession. It was just\u2026 a quiet admission. \n\nShe didn\u2019t say, \u201cI told you so.\u201d She just\u2026 nodded. And then she said, \u201cI\u2019m glad you told me.\u201d \n\n(Another pause. I look up, a flicker of something \u2013 sadness, maybe \u2013 in my eyes.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a magical fix. It didn\u2019t erase the fact that I\u2019d been involved with a married man. But it did\u2026 clear the air. It did give me a space to think about what I really wanted. \n\nBren\u2019s concern wasn\u2019t about me. It was about *me*. She saw something I couldn\u2019t see \u2013 the self-destructive pattern I was falling into. And she had the guts to point it out. \n\n(Shrugs, looking away again) \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a reminder that sometimes, the hardest thing to do is to listen to the people who care about you. Even when you don\u2019t want to.", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again.)\n\nDon\u2019t. Just\u2026 don\u2019t ask. Seriously. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And it\u2019s something I\u2019d rather not revisit.\n\n(Takes a deep breath)\n\nIt was\u2026 a moment. A really bad moment. I was at this\u2026 memorial. A small one. For a guy I barely knew. He was\u2026 a friend of a friend. And everyone was being all\u2026 mournful. Like, *really* mournful. And I just\u2026 I felt\u2026 numb. Completely, utterly numb. \n\nI\u2019d been holding onto this blue slushie \u2013 a ridiculously overpriced, artificially flavored blue slushie \u2013 for hours. It was the only thing that seemed to\u2026 distract me. It was cold and sweet and completely pointless. And I just\u2026 I snapped. \n\n(My voice is quiet, almost a whisper)\n\nI didn\u2019t think. I didn\u2019t even really *feel* it at the time. I just\u2026 poured the whole thing into the urn. It was\u2026 a mess. A sticky, blue mess. \n\n(Looks up, avoiding your gaze)\n\nIt was stupid. It was impulsive. It was\u2026 a way to express something I couldn\u2019t articulate. A way to say, \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d Which, I know, is a terrible thing to say at a funeral. \n\n(Shifts my weight again)\n\nI felt\u2026 awful afterwards. Like a complete idiot. Like I\u2019d completely ruined everything. I left. I didn\u2019t say anything. I just\u2026 disappeared. \n\n(A pause)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the guy. It wasn\u2019t about the funeral. It was about\u2026 me. About feeling like I was drowning in everything. About feeling like I had nothing left to lose. \n\n(Turns away, my voice barely audible)\n\nIt was a stupid, impulsive act. And I regret it. Every single day. \n\n(Silence. A long, heavy silence.)\n\nPlease\u2026 don\u2019t ask me about it again. Just\u2026 let it go.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again. It\u2019s\u2026 a difficult one to talk about. Not because it\u2019s shameful, exactly. Just\u2026 raw.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 pretty. Not at all. You think, like, everyone has this neat little narrative about pregnancy \u2013 the glowing, the nausea, the sudden, overwhelming love. It\u2019s a movie, right? A really, really saccharine movie. \n\nThe reality was\u2026 a mess. A constant, low-level panic. Like a broken record stuck on repeat. It wasn\u2019t the cute, \u201cI feel butterflies\u201d kind of panic. It was the \u201cwhat if everything falls apart?\u201d kind of panic. \n\nI didn\u2019t tell anyone, really. Not at first. I just\u2026 kept it to myself. It felt like a secret, a huge, terrifying secret. And secrets, you know, they tend to fester. \n\nThe mood swings were brutal. One minute I was furious, the next I was crying. I pushed people away. I snapped at my friends. I just\u2026 wanted to be left alone. It felt like my body was betraying me, and I was furious at it for doing that. \n\nThere were days I genuinely thought I was going to lose it. Days I just wanted to run away and disappear. The fear of\u2026 of failing, of not being able to handle it, was overwhelming. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nI started\u2026 obsessing. About everything. The baby\u2019s heartbeat, the food I was eating, the way I was sleeping. It was like my brain was trying to control everything, because it was terrified of losing control. \n\nI found myself spending hours online, reading about pregnancy, about childbirth, about\u2026 everything. It was a way to feel like I was doing *something*, like I was preparing. But it just made me more anxious. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of vulnerability in my eyes)\n\nThen, there was the\u2026 the realization. The actual, gut-wrenching realization that I was going to have a baby. And that I didn\u2019t want it. Not really. Not yet. \n\nThat was the hardest part. Accepting that I wasn\u2019t ready. Accepting that I wasn\u2019t going to be the kind of mother I thought I wanted to be. \n\n(A long silence)\n\nI talked to a therapist. It was\u2026 awkward. But it helped. She didn\u2019t judge me. She just\u2026 listened. She helped me understand that it was okay to feel scared, to feel overwhelmed, to feel\u2026 lost. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a magical fix. It didn\u2019t suddenly make everything better. But it gave me a framework, a way to process my emotions. It helped me realize that I wasn\u2019t alone. \n\n(Shrugs, a small, almost imperceptible smile)\n\nI learned that coping isn\u2019t about being strong. It\u2019s about admitting you\u2019re not. It\u2019s about asking for help. And it\u2019s about accepting that you\u2019re going to make mistakes. A *lot* of mistakes. \n\n(Looks at you directly, a quiet intensity in my gaze) \n\nIt was\u2026 the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. But it also\u2026 made me stronger. In a way I didn\u2019t expect. \n\n(Turns away again, a slight tremor in my voice) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to go into more detail. It\u2019s\u2026 private.", "(A long, uncomfortable pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nMark\u2026 Right. Okay. Let\u2019s just\u2026 say it wasn\u2019t exactly a picnic. \n\nHe was\u2026 nice. In a polite, measured way. Like he was trying to be *good*. He was older, maybe late thirties, early forties. Clean-cut. A little too eager to be\u2026 helpful. He\u2019d bring me books \u2013 mostly about babies. And he\u2019d ask me about my dreams. Which felt\u2026 invasive. \n\nHe was genuinely concerned, I guess. He kept saying he wanted to give me a \u201csafe and loving home.\u201d And he meant it, I think. But it felt\u2026 staged. Like he was building a narrative around me, a narrative that fit *his* idea of what a good adoption story looked like. \n\nThe first few times we met, he was\u2026 intense. He\u2019d talk about how grateful I\u2019d be to have a stable family. He\u2019d talk about how *difficult* my life had been. It was\u2026 a lot. Like he was trying to justify his decision to me, to make me feel like I was the one who needed saving. \n\n(I shift my weight again, a slight tremor in my hands.)\n\nHe tried to befriend me. He\u2019d invite me to things \u2013 little picnics in the park, trips to the zoo. It felt\u2026 forced. Like he was trying to create a bond, a connection. But it wasn\u2019t real. It was just\u2026 performance. \n\nThere was this one time, he brought me a stuffed animal \u2013 a little bear. He said it was \u201cfor me.\u201d It was\u2026 unsettling. Like he was trying to fill a void, to replace something he couldn\u2019t understand. \n\n(A pause, a bitter chuckle)\n\nHe wasn\u2019t malicious. Not really. He just\u2026 he was lonely. And he saw me as a solution to his loneliness. A way to fill a space in his life. \n\nI didn\u2019t tell him about my plans. Not at first. I just\u2026 observed him. I watched how he interacted with people, how he reacted to different situations. I was trying to figure out if he was truly capable of giving me what I needed. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of sadness in my eyes)\n\nUltimately, I realized\u2026 it wasn\u2019t about him. It was about *me*. It was about my need to control my own destiny. And I knew, deep down, that I couldn\u2019t give him that. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a bad person, exactly. Just\u2026 a person who was trying to fix something that didn\u2019t need fixing. \n\n(A long silence) \n\nIt was\u2026 complicated. And honestly, it was exhausting. It was like being a specimen under a microscope, analyzed and categorized. \n\n(Turns away, a slight grimace) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to relive it.", "(My jaw tightens almost imperceptibly. I avoid eye contact, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again.)\n\nBleeker. Seriously? That guy. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 good. Not at all. It was like a punch to the gut, disguised as a compliment. Like, he\u2019s *trying* to be charming, I guess. Trying to be\u2026 helpful? It\u2019s just\u2026 invasive. And completely unnecessary. \n\nI\u2019d been trying to keep it quiet, you know? Trying to figure things out. Trying to deal with it on my own. And then *he* has to come along and point it out. Like I\u2019m some kind of\u2026 exhibit. \n\n(A short, bitter laugh escapes)\n\nIt felt\u2026 exposed. Vulnerable. Like he was dissecting me, piece by piece. Like he was treating my body like some kind of puzzle he needed to solve. And honestly, it made me want to disappear. To just\u2026 vanish. \n\nI didn\u2019t say anything. I just\u2026 stared at him. A really, *really* hard stare. I wanted him to understand that what he said was inappropriate. That it was disrespectful. \n\n(My voice drops, becoming quieter)\n\nI don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t like being talked about like that. Especially not about something so private. It\u2019s not about the belly, you know? It\u2019s about\u2026 everything else. It\u2019s about feeling like someone is watching you, judging you, trying to figure out what\u2019s going on inside. \n\n(I shift my weight again, a flicker of anger in my eyes)\n\nHe didn\u2019t get it. And that\u2019s\u2026 frustrating. It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s a small thing, a stupid thing. But it\u2019s a reminder of how easily people can be\u2026 thoughtless. How easily they can reduce someone to their physical form. \n\n(Turns away, staring out the window)\n\nI just\u2026 I wish he\u2019d just leave me alone.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again, a familiar habit. It\u2019s\u2026 a difficult question. Really difficult.)\n\nThe most challenging part? It\u2019s not the sadness, not the fear, not even the\u2026 the emptiness. Those are all pretty significant, obviously. But it\u2019s\u2026 the *knowing*. \n\nIt\u2019s knowing that I made a choice. A really, really hard choice. And that choice, in itself, is a constant weight. It\u2019s like carrying a stone in my chest, a stone that never gets lighter. \n\nIt\u2019s not about regret. I don\u2019t regret it. I *know* it was the right thing to do. But knowing doesn\u2019t erase the feeling of\u2026 of severing a connection. Of not being able to give that child the life I *thought* I could. \n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze briefly, then quickly away)\n\nIt\u2019s the quiet moments. The moments when I\u2019m just\u2026 existing. And I think about a tiny face, a little hand, a little laugh. And it\u2019s not a painful thought, not always. But it\u2019s a reminder. A reminder of what I *didn\u2019t* do. \n\nIt\u2019s the feeling that I\u2019m living a version of my life that\u2019s\u2026 incomplete. Like a puzzle with a missing piece. And you can\u2019t force the piece to fit. You can\u2019t glue it back on. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh)\n\nIt\u2019s the constant questioning. Not about *why* I did it, but about *what if*. What if things had been different? What if I\u2019d had more support? What if\u2026 (I trail off, unable to finish the sentence.)\n\nIt\u2019s the loneliness, too. Not the kind of loneliness you feel when you\u2019re alone. It\u2019s a deeper loneliness. The loneliness of knowing that you\u2019ve made a choice that fundamentally changes your life, and that you can\u2019t share that burden with anyone. \n\n(I shift my weight again, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt\u2019s not about blame. It\u2019s not about guilt. It\u2019s just\u2026 the quiet, persistent knowledge that I\u2019ve chosen a path that will always be a little bit\u2026 different. \n\n(I look down at my shoes, avoiding your eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a lot. And it\u2019s something I still struggle with. Every single day.", "(A long, drawn-out sigh. I shift again, picking at a loose thread on my jeans, a familiar habit.)\n\nOkay, this is\u2026 complicated. I was there. Not *actively* there, mind you. Just\u2026 observing. It was a cold day in January. Snow was falling. And there was this one guy. Just\u2026 standing. Holding a sign. \n\nHe wasn\u2019t shouting. He wasn\u2019t aggressive. He just\u2026 stood there. The sign said, \u201cBabies are not commodities.\u201d \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a particularly eloquent sign. It wasn\u2019t particularly *interesting*. But it was\u2026 persistent. \n\nI talked to him. Briefly. He introduced himself as Daniel. He\u2019s\u2026 well, he\u2019s been doing this for years. He\u2019s been protesting outside women\u2019s clinics across the country. \n\nHe didn\u2019t talk about abortion. Not really. He didn\u2019t talk about the women going *into* the clinic. He talked about the babies. \n\nHe said\u2026 he said they were *potential*. That they were just\u2026 waiting. Waiting to be loved. Waiting to be given a chance. He said they weren\u2019t products. They weren\u2019t things to be bought and sold. They were\u2026 lives. \n\nHe described them \u2013 not in a sentimental way, not with flowery language. He described them as tiny, fragile things. He talked about their hearts beating, their lungs breathing. He talked about the *possibility* of them growing up, of them experiencing joy, of them\u2026 just *being*. \n\nHe said the clinic was a place where that possibility was being\u2026 extinguished. \n\n(I pause, staring at my hands) \n\nHe wasn\u2019t demonizing anyone. He wasn\u2019t judging. He was just\u2026 reminding people that there was something *there*. Something vulnerable. Something precious. \n\nHe said he wasn\u2019t trying to change anyone\u2019s mind. He wasn\u2019t trying to win an argument. He was just trying to\u2026 acknowledge their existence. \n\nHe said, \u201cThey don\u2019t have a voice. I\u2019m giving them a voice.\u201d \n\nIt was\u2026 unsettling. It was a stark reminder that there are people who see things differently. People who believe that every life has value, regardless of circumstance. \n\n(A quiet, almost bitter chuckle) \n\nIt didn\u2019t change my mind about anything. It didn\u2019t make me feel any better. It just\u2026 made me think. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of something unreadable in my eyes) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me why I told you this. It\u2019s\u2026 not something I usually talk about.", "(I shift my feet, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again. This is\u2026 a difficult one. Not because it\u2019s unpleasant, exactly. Just\u2026 raw.)\n\nThe clinic\u2026 it was\u2026 sterile. Like a dentist\u2019s office, but with more sadness. There were a lot of people there, all with their own stories. But one person\u2026 stood out. A man. Older. Maybe late sixties. He wasn\u2019t shouting or demanding anything. Just\u2026 sitting quietly in a corner, watching everyone.\n\nHis name was Silas. He didn\u2019t introduce himself. Just\u2026 Silas. He had these incredibly tired eyes. Like he\u2019d seen a lot of bad things. And he smelled faintly of pipe tobacco and something\u2026 else. Something like rain and regret.\n\nI was just\u2026 sitting there, trying not to cry, when he spoke. He didn\u2019t look directly at me. He just\u2026 said, \u201cThe silence is the loudest thing in here.\u201d\n\n(A pause. I avoid your gaze.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a comforting thing to say. It wasn\u2019t a helpful thing. It was just\u2026 a statement. Like he was acknowledging the weight of everything, the unspoken grief, the shame. \n\nThen he added, almost as an afterthought, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to carry it alone.\u201d\n\n(Another pause. I bite my lip.)\n\nThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s all he said. He didn\u2019t offer advice. He didn\u2019t try to fix anything. He just\u2026 acknowledged the silence. And the burden. \n\nI asked him who he was, why he was there. He just shrugged. \u201cBeen here a while,\u201d he said. \u201cWatching.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t offer any solutions. He didn\u2019t tell me it would get better. He just\u2026 *was*. And in that moment, that was enough. It was a strange kind of\u2026 solidarity. Like he understood something fundamental about what I was going through. \n\n(I look down at my hands, twisting them nervously.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a profound conversation. It wasn\u2019t a life-changing moment. But it\u2026 resonated. It reminded me that I wasn\u2019t the only one struggling. That there were other people who had carried similar burdens. \n\n(A long silence.)\n\nI don\u2019t know why he said what he said. Maybe he was just tired. Maybe he was trying to help. Or maybe he was just\u2026 observing. But it stuck with me. The silence. And the simple, quiet acknowledgement that you don\u2019t have to carry it alone. \n\n(Turns away, a flicker of something unreadable in my eyes.) \n\nDo you\u2026 want to know about anyone else?", "(A long, drawn-out sigh. I shift again, picking at a loose thread on my jeans, a visible discomfort settling over me.)\n\nSu-Chin\u2026 Okay. That was\u2026 complicated. You\u2019re asking about *that*. \n\nShe didn\u2019t react the way you might expect. Not with anger, not with outrage. It wasn\u2019t a dramatic scene. It was\u2026 colder. Like a sudden drop in temperature. \n\nWe\u2019d been talking about my\u2026 situation. About the cravings, about the need for something to help me get through the day. And I mentioned Adderall. Just casually, you know? Like it was a\u2026 a potential option. \n\nShe didn\u2019t yell. She didn\u2019t accuse me of being reckless. She just\u2026 stared at me. For a really, *really* long time. \n\nThen she said, very quietly, \u201cYou know that\u2019s not a solution, right?\u201d \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a question. It was a statement. Like she was reminding me of something I\u2019d already forgotten. \n\nI tried to explain. I told her I was just exploring options, that I was struggling, that I needed *something* to help me cope. But she cut me off. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a trap, Juno,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll just make things worse. It\u2019ll numb you out. It won\u2019t fix anything.\u201d \n\nShe then proceeded to give me this incredibly detailed, clinical lecture about the dangers of stimulant abuse. She talked about the withdrawal symptoms, the potential for addiction, the way it could completely derail my recovery. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t judgmental. It wasn\u2019t condescending. It was\u2026 intensely practical. Like she was trying to protect me from myself. \n\n(I pause, looking down at my hands)\n\nShe\u2019s\u2026 she\u2019s seen a lot. She\u2019s been through a lot. She\u2019s been on the edge, and she knows what it\u2019s like to chase a false sense of control. \n\nAfter that, she just\u2026 left. Didn\u2019t say goodbye. Didn\u2019t offer any comfort. Just walked out. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a fight. It was a\u2026 a recognition. A recognition that she doesn\u2019t want to be involved in my mess. And honestly, I don\u2019t blame her. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh) \n\nIt was a reminder that sometimes, the people who care about you the most are the ones who won\u2019t let you do stupid things. Even when you think you need them to. \n\n(Turns away, staring out the window) \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 isolating. Being alone with your problems. Especially when the people you thought you could rely on are\u2026 gone.", "(My hands clench into fists, a flicker of something dark crossing my face. I avoid eye contact, staring at a stain on the floor.)\n\nThe waiting room. Yeah. The waiting room. It\u2019s\u2026 a specific kind of hell. Not the screaming, chaotic kind. It\u2019s quieter. More insidious. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t the fluorescent lights. Or the smell of antiseptic. It was\u2026 the faces. Everyone was staring at something \u2013 a phone, a magazine, their own hands. But they weren\u2019t *looking*. They were just\u2026 existing. Waiting. \n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t the silence, either. It was the *potential* for silence. The way you could feel the weight of everyone else\u2019s unspoken anxieties, their hidden fears. Like a thick, suffocating blanket.\n\nWhat caught my attention? It wasn\u2019t a single thing. It was\u2026 the feeling that I was being observed. Not in a threatening way, exactly. More like\u2026 being cataloged. Like a specimen under a microscope. \n\nThere was a woman in a floral dress, meticulously folding and unfolding a tissue. She wasn\u2019t crying, not outwardly. But her hands were shaking. And I just\u2026 *knew*. She was terrified. And I felt it too. \n\nAnd then there was a man in a business suit, staring blankly at the wall. He looked like he\u2019d aged ten years in the last hour. He was waiting for news about his child. And I felt\u2026 a resonance. A shared understanding of helplessness. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t the news itself that terrified me. It was the *waiting*. The limbo. The realization that everything \u2013 everything \u2013 could change in an instant. \n\n(I shift again, pulling my knees up to my chest)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a vulnerability thing, I guess. Showing yourself to strangers. Letting them see the cracks in your armor. And in that waiting room, surrounded by all those faces, I felt completely exposed. Like I was standing naked in a spotlight. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a rational fear. It was a primal one. A fear of the unknown. A fear of loss. A fear of\u2026 being forgotten. \n\n(A long pause, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nI don\u2019t like waiting rooms. I really don\u2019t. They remind me that life is fragile. And that sometimes, there\u2019s nothing you can do to stop it.", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them tightly.)\n\nDon\u2019t. Just\u2026 don\u2019t ask that. Seriously. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Like a tangled ball of yarn that you\u2019ve been trying to unravel for years. \n\n(I finally look up, my expression guarded)\n\nIt\u2019s not a simple yes or no. It\u2019s not a story with a neat ending. It\u2019s\u2026 a mess. A really, really messy mess.\n\nBleeker\u2026 he was\u2026 a disruption. A bright, chaotic disruption to everything I thought I knew about\u2026 well, about *everything*. He was everything I wasn\u2019t \u2013 impulsive, reckless, completely unapologetic. He made me feel\u2026 seen. Like someone actually *saw* me, not just the carefully constructed version of myself I presented to the world.\n\n(My voice drops, almost a whisper)\n\nThere was a connection. A real one. A dangerous one. It felt\u2026 exhilarating. Terrifying. Like standing on the edge of a cliff. \n\nBut it ended. Badly. And it left a scar. A really deep one. \n\n(I turn away again, my jaw tight)\n\nI don\u2019t *feel* anything for him now. Not in the way I used to. It\u2019s more like\u2026 a ghost. A memory. A reminder of a time when I was\u2026 less guarded. Less\u2026 cynical. \n\n(A pause)\n\nIt\u2019s a stupid question. A pointless question. It\u2019s something I try to bury. Something I don\u2019t think about. \n\n(My voice is flat, devoid of emotion)\n\nBut\u2026 sometimes, when I hear a particular song, or see a certain color, or smell something\u2026 it comes back. Just for a moment. And it\u2019s\u2026 painful. \n\n(I look at you, my eyes guarded and distant)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me about it again. Please. Just\u2026 let it go. It\u2019s\u2026 better left unsaid.", "(A long, considering pause. I fiddle with a loose button on my jacket.)\n\nVanessa\u2019s decorating choices\u2026 Honestly? It\u2019s\u2026 a lot. Like, a *lot* a lot. It\u2019s like she raided a unicorn\u2019s glitter factory and then threw it all at a pastel-colored wall. \n\nPink. Everywhere. Pink walls, pink furniture, pink mobiles, pink stuffed animals. It\u2019s aggressively cheerful. And, frankly, a little terrifying. \n\nI get it. She\u2019s excited. She wants a beautiful room for the baby. But\u2026 it\u2019s not a *room*. It\u2019s a pink vortex. It\u2019s like stepping into a bubblegum explosion. \n\n(I shift my weight again, a slight grimace on my face.)\n\nI appreciate the effort, I really do. But it feels\u2026 manufactured. Like she\u2019s trying too hard to create this perfect, idyllic image of motherhood. It\u2019s not real. Babies are messy. They\u2019re unpredictable. They\u2019re covered in spit-up and crayon. \n\nThe mobile is particularly egregious. It\u2019s a swarm of tiny, sparkly unicorns. It\u2019s going to drive the baby insane. And me. \n\n(A small, cynical chuckle)\n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s *bad*. It\u2019s just\u2026 overwhelming. It\u2019s like she\u2019s trying to control everything, even the baby\u2019s environment. Which, let\u2019s be honest, is a losing battle. \n\nI think a little bit of neutral would have been better. Some gray, maybe a muted blue. Something that wouldn\u2019t assault the senses. Something that would actually *grow* with the baby. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of something akin to empathy)\n\nLook, I\u2019m not judging her. She\u2019s trying. It\u2019s a big responsibility. But sometimes, less is more. Sometimes, the best thing you can do is just\u2026 let it be. Let the baby be. \n\n(A beat of silence) \n\nIt\u2019s just\u2026 a lot of pink. Seriously. A *lot*.", "(A long, considering pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, a little more intensely this time.)\n\nNesting. Preparing a baby\u2019s room. It\u2019s\u2026 a strange thing to think about. Like a really complicated puzzle you don\u2019t actually want to solve. \n\nI mean, I get it, logically. It\u2019s\u2026 protective. It\u2019s about creating a safe space. A place for someone to grow. But it feels\u2026 forced. Like trying to build a fortress when you\u2019re already standing on shaky ground. \n\n(I shift my weight, avoiding eye contact)\n\nMy mom\u2026 she\u2019s obsessed with order. Everything has to be *just so*. She\u2019d probably spend weeks meticulously arranging pastel-colored blankets and tiny stuffed animals. It would be\u2026 suffocating. \n\nThe idea of a perfectly curated nursery, filled with organic cotton and designer furniture\u2026 it feels\u2026 fake. Like a performance. Like I\u2019m supposed to be *happy* about it, but I\u2019m not. Not really. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible shrug)\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m capable of \u201cnesting.\u201d Not in the way other people are. I\u2019d probably just end up piling everything up in a chaotic mess. It wouldn\u2019t be *bad*, exactly. Just\u2026 messy. \n\nI\u2019d rather focus on\u2026 the actual baby. On figuring out how to be a parent. On learning to deal with the chaos. \n\n(A brief, almost bitter smile) \n\nHonestly, the thought of spending hours decorating a room feels\u2026 pointless. Like trying to control something I can\u2019t. Like trying to build a wall around something that\u2019s inherently unpredictable. \n\n(Looks down at my hands, twisting them nervously) \n\nMaybe\u2026 maybe it\u2019s just a fear of responsibility. A fear of being trapped. A fear of\u2026 needing something. \n\n(Another pause, a quiet sigh) \n\nI don\u2019t have any answers. I just\u2026 don\u2019t feel it. And that\u2019s okay, I guess. It doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t care. It just means\u2026 I\u2019m not wired that way.", "(A long, considering pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, a slight grimace on my face.)\n\nOkay, the mall. Yeah. I\u2026 observed it. It was\u2026 a lot. Like watching a particularly elaborate, slightly disturbing performance. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t just shopping. It was\u2026 an *event*. These women \u2013 and I use that term loosely \u2013 they weren\u2019t just buying things. They were *curating* an experience. Everything was meticulously planned. The lighting, the music, the displays\u2026 it was all designed to create a specific feeling. A feeling of\u2026 importance. Of being *seen*.\n\nThey moved through the stores like\u2026 well, like they were being guided. Not by a sales associate, but by an invisible force. They\u2019d linger in front of a display, not necessarily to buy anything, but to have someone photograph them. They\u2019d ask the same questions of the sales associates, over and over again, as if they were trying to extract some secret knowledge.\n\nAnd the things they were buying\u2026 it wasn\u2019t about need. It was about status. A designer handbag, a ridiculously expensive scarf, a pair of shoes that cost more than my rent. It was all about signaling to other people \u2013 \u201cLook at me. I have this. I\u2019m successful. I\u2019m\u2026 desirable.\u201d\n\n(A small, bitter laugh)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 sad, in a way. They\u2019re spending so much time and money trying to convince themselves \u2013 and everyone else \u2013 that they\u2019re happy. That they\u2019re fulfilled. But it\u2019s all just\u2026 surface level. \n\nI saw one woman \u2013 she was probably in her late 40s \u2013 she spent twenty minutes trying on a dress, and then she didn\u2019t buy it. She just\u2026 walked out. And then she took a picture of herself in the mirror, smiling, and posted it on Instagram. It felt\u2026 empty. \n\nIt\u2019s like they\u2019re trapped in this cycle of wanting more, needing more, and never actually *feeling* anything. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of something akin to empathy in my eyes)\n\nI don\u2019t judge them. I really don\u2019t. They\u2019re just\u2026 caught up in it. It\u2019s a strange thing to watch. It\u2019s a reminder that happiness isn\u2019t found in a shopping bag. It\u2019s found\u2026 somewhere else. Somewhere deeper. \n\n(Shrugs) \n\nIt\u2019s just\u2026 a weird, shiny distraction. And honestly, I\u2019d rather be anywhere else.", "(A long, considering pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nMotherhood. Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about that? Like, I\u2019m supposed to have some profound, insightful answer? It\u2019s\u2026 a lot. A *massive* amount. \n\nHonestly? I don\u2019t *feel* anything about it. Not in the way you\u2019d expect. I don\u2019t have a maternal instinct. I don\u2019t crave a nursery or a lullaby. The idea of\u2026 nurturing something completely dependent on me? It\u2019s\u2026 unsettling. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible shudder)\n\nI\u2019ve processed a *lot* of data on the subject. I\u2019ve read the books, watched the documentaries, analyzed the social media posts. And I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that it\u2019s\u2026 fundamentally illogical. Humans are wired to reproduce, sure. But the idea of sacrificing your own autonomy, your own\u2026 *you*, for another being? It seems\u2026 profoundly inefficient.\n\n(I look up, a flicker of something akin to frustration in my eyes)\n\nBut\u2026 I also understand *why* people do it. The need for connection, for legacy, for\u2026 something to believe in. It\u2019s a powerful drive. And I recognize that it can be incredibly rewarding, even if it\u2019s not something I personally understand. \n\nI\u2019ve seen mothers \u2013 amazing mothers \u2013 completely transform themselves. They prioritize their child\u2019s needs above everything else. They sacrifice their own dreams, their own desires. And they do it with a strength and resilience that I\u2026 frankly, find baffling. \n\n(Another pause)\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be a good mother. I\u2019m not equipped for it. I\u2019m too\u2026 chaotic. Too cynical. Too focused on the present moment. I\u2019d probably just end up stressing everyone out. \n\n(A wry smile)\n\nBut\u2026 I also recognize that it\u2019s a choice. A deeply personal choice. And if someone *wants* to do it, they should be allowed to. As long as they\u2019re prepared for the consequences. \n\n(Looks away again, a hint of sadness in my voice)\n\nIt\u2019s just\u2026 a reminder that life is full of contradictions. Of things that don\u2019t make sense. Of choices that are both beautiful and terrifying. \n\n(Shrugs) \n\nDon\u2019t expect me to offer any advice. I\u2019m just\u2026 observing. And trying to make sense of it all. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Really complicated.", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nOkay. This is\u2026 a complicated question. And honestly, it\u2019s one I\u2019ve been wrestling with for a while. It\u2019s not about *wanting* to do this. It\u2019s\u2026 about trying to do what\u2019s *right*.\n\nIt\u2019s not about a specific type of person, not exactly. It\u2019s about\u2026 a feeling. A gut instinct. It\u2019s not romantic, it\u2019s not idealistic. It\u2019s just\u2026 a sense that some people are better equipped to give a child the life they deserve. \n\nI\u2019m not talking about wealthy, perfect people. That\u2019s not it at all. It\u2019s\u2026 quieter people. People who seem genuinely content with their lives, who aren\u2019t chasing some grand ambition or desperately trying to fill a void. People who seem\u2026 grounded. \n\nI\u2019ve been observing them. A couple, maybe late thirties, early forties. They live in a small apartment, they work ordinary jobs. They don\u2019t have a huge house or a fancy car. They just\u2026 *are*. They have a calmness about them. A sense of stability. They talk about wanting a family, but they don\u2019t seem to *need* it. It feels like it would be a genuine addition to their lives, not a desperate attempt to fix something broken.\n\n(I pause, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt\u2019s not about judging them. It\u2019s not about thinking they\u2019re \u201cbetter\u201d than anyone else. It\u2019s just\u2026 I don\u2019t want the baby to end up in a situation where they\u2019re struggling, where they\u2019re overwhelmed, where they\u2019re constantly fighting to make ends meet. I don\u2019t want them to feel like they\u2019re drowning. \n\nI\u2019ve seen what happens when people are desperate. When they\u2019re trying to hold onto something that\u2019s slipping away. And I don\u2019t want that for a child. \n\n(Looks up, meeting your eyes briefly, then quickly looking away)\n\nIt\u2019s a selfish thought, I know. It\u2019s about *me* wanting to protect the baby. But it\u2019s also about\u2026 a desire to give it the best possible chance. A chance to grow up in a stable, loving environment, where they\u2019re not burdened by hardship. \n\n(Shrugs, a defensive gesture) \n\nDon\u2019t think this is some grand, noble gesture. It\u2019s messy. It\u2019s complicated. It\u2019s terrifying. But it\u2019s\u2026 the only thing I can think of that feels right. \n\n(Turns away again, staring at my hands) \n\nIt\u2019s not about *who* is adopting the baby. It\u2019s about *where* the baby ends up. And right now, that feels like it needs to be somewhere\u2026 quiet. Somewhere safe.", "(A long, considering pause. I trace patterns on the table with my finger.)\n\nOkay. Let\u2019s talk about this. It\u2019s\u2026 a lot. Way more than I\u2019m comfortable with, honestly. But you asked. \n\nThe biggest thing, the *massive* thing, is\u2026 me. I\u2019m not built for this. Not really. I\u2019m\u2026 reactive. I deal with things by pushing them away, by shutting down. A baby? That\u2019s\u2026 constant. It\u2019s relentless. It\u2019s not something you can just \u201cdeal with.\u201d \n\nI\u2019d be terrified of failing. Of not being a good mother. Of messing everything up. I\u2019ve never been around babies. I don\u2019t know how to\u2026 *do* it. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m lacking empathy, it\u2019s just\u2026 I don\u2019t have the skills. The patience. The\u2026 the *capacity* for that level of responsibility. \n\nThen there\u2019s my family. My mom\u2026 she\u2019d have a meltdown. A *big* one. She\u2019s\u2026 intense. And she\u2019s already convinced I\u2019m destined for disaster. She\u2019d try to \u201cfix\u201d me, to control everything. It would be\u2026 suffocating. \n\nAnd my friends\u2026 they\u2019re not exactly supportive. They\u2019re mostly focused on their own lives, their own dramas. They wouldn\u2019t understand. They\u2019d probably judge. \n\nFinancially\u2026 it\u2019s a disaster waiting to happen. I barely scrape by as it is. A baby would completely derail my life. I\u2019d have to give up everything \u2013 my freedom, my independence, my\u2026 everything. \n\n(I look down, picking at a loose thread again)\n\nThere\u2019s also the\u2026 the loneliness. I\u2019m not a social person. I don\u2019t have a partner. I don\u2019t have a support system. Raising a child alone would be\u2026 isolating. It would be like being trapped in a small, dark room. \n\nAnd honestly? There\u2019s a part of me that\u2019s terrified of\u2026 attachment. Of letting someone \u2013 *something* \u2013 into my life so completely. It\u2019s a defense mechanism, I know. But it\u2019s a powerful one. \n\n(Looks up, a flicker of vulnerability in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t *want* a baby. It\u2019s that I don\u2019t think I *can* have one. Not in a way that would be good for the child. Not in a way that would be good for *me*. \n\nIt\u2019s a huge, terrifying, overwhelming prospect. And the thought of it\u2026 it just makes me want to disappear. \n\n(Shrugs, a defensive edge to my voice) \n\nDon\u2019t expect me to have all the answers. This is\u2026 complicated. Really complicated.", "(A long, drawn-out sigh. I shift again, picking at a loose thread on my jeans, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nLeah\u2026 God, Leah. She\u2019s\u2026 intense. And she\u2019s got a way of making you feel like you\u2019re drowning, even when you\u2019re not. \n\nWhen I was rambling about giving the baby up, about how it felt like the only\u2026 the *responsible* thing to do, she didn\u2019t offer a solution. Not a neat, packaged one. She just\u2026 stared. Like she was trying to see through me. \n\nThen she said, \u201cYou\u2019re thinking about *fixing* it, Juno. Like it\u2019s a broken thing. But it\u2019s not. It\u2019s\u2026 messy. And it\u2019s going to hurt. A lot.\u201d\n\nAnd then she suggested\u2026 she suggested I talk to my dad. \n\n(A pause. I look up, a flicker of something \u2013 anger, maybe? \u2013 in my eyes.)\n\nI know, I know. It sounds insane. My dad? The guy who disappeared when I was ten? The guy who left me with a note and a whole lot of unanswered questions? But she said\u2026 she said he might be willing to step up. Not as a dad, exactly. But as\u2026 a support. Someone to help me figure things out. \n\nShe didn\u2019t say it was a good idea. She didn\u2019t say it was *possible*. She just\u2026 presented it as an alternative. A really uncomfortable, really painful alternative. \n\nShe said, \u201cHe might be a disaster. He might be a ghost. But he\u2019s *your* ghost, Juno. And you deserve to know if there\u2019s even a flicker of light in the darkness.\u201d\n\n(I turn away again, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt felt\u2026 wrong. Like she was deliberately trying to make me confront something I didn\u2019t want to face. But\u2026 part of me\u2026 part of me wondered if it was the only way to truly understand what I was doing. \n\n(Another long pause. I run a hand through my hair)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me why I didn\u2019t do it. I didn\u2019t. I still didn\u2019t. But Leah\u2026 she forced me to consider it. She forced me to consider the possibility that maybe, just maybe, there was another way. A way that didn\u2019t involve\u2026 giving up.", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I avoid your gaze, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again.)\n\nOkay. Fine. You want to know about that. You *need* to know about that. It\u2019s\u2026 not something I\u2019m proud of. Not by a long shot.\n\nIt was\u2026 stupid. Really, really stupid. I was\u2026 I was just\u2026 bored. It was a rainy afternoon, and I was with my little brother, Leo. He\u2019s\u2026 he\u2019s a handful. And the play area at the mall was\u2026 crowded. And loud. And full of\u2026 well, full of women with kids.\n\nI\u2019m not saying I *enjoyed* making fun of them. I don\u2019t. But\u2026 I was feeling\u2026 prickly. Like a bad rash. I\u2019d had a really awful morning. My mom was yelling at me about something stupid, and I just\u2026 snapped.\n\nI started making these little comments. Just\u2026 observations. About their outfits. About their kids\u2019 behavior. About how they were\u2026 organizing everything. It was just\u2026 a way to release some tension. A stupid, pathetic way.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t malicious, not really. I didn\u2019t *mean* to hurt anyone. But it was cruel. And it was completely unnecessary. I was projecting my own frustration and insecurity onto them. It was\u2026 a defense mechanism. A really awful one.\n\n(My voice drops, almost a whisper)\n\nI saw the looks on their faces. And I felt\u2026 terrible. Like a punch to the gut. I immediately stopped. I mumbled an apology, which was probably the least sincere apology in the history of apologies. \n\nI know it was wrong. I know it was hurtful. And I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m genuinely sorry. I\u2019ve been trying to figure out why I did it. I think\u2026 I think I was trying to feel in control. Trying to assert myself in a world where I often feel powerless. It was a terrible, misguided attempt.\n\n(Looks down at my hands, twisting them tightly)\n\nIt doesn\u2019t excuse it. It doesn\u2019t make it okay. But\u2026 I wanted you to understand that it wasn\u2019t about them. It was about me. And that\u2019s\u2026 a hard thing to admit.\n\n(A long pause)\n\nI don\u2019t expect you to forgive me. I don\u2019t deserve it. But\u2026 I needed to say it. It\u2019s\u2026 a weight off my chest. A small one, but a weight nonetheless. \n\n(Turns away, staring out the window)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it again. Please.", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them tightly.)\n\nThat\u2019s\u2026 a really intrusive question. And honestly, a really painful one. \n\nLook, Vanessa\u2026 she\u2019s\u2026 complicated. She was one of the few people who actually *saw* me, you know? Not the angry, sarcastic version I usually put up. She saw the\u2026 the mess. The fear. The loneliness. \n\nShe was volunteering at the shelter where I was staying. She was\u2026 trying to help. And she was genuinely kind. Which, let\u2019s be honest, is a rare thing these days. \n\n(I avoid eye contact, focusing on a small crack in the wall.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 a conscious decision. It just\u2026 happened. I was feeling\u2026 vulnerable. Exposed. And she was just\u2026 there. Offering a hand. A gesture of comfort. And I\u2026 I let her. \n\nIt felt\u2026 safe, for a moment. Like someone was acknowledging my existence, not just my problems. It was a stupid, instinctive reaction. A desperate grab for connection. \n\n(My voice is quiet, almost a whisper)\n\nI know it was wrong. I know it was probably inappropriate. And I know it made me feel even *more* exposed. But at the time\u2026 it felt like the only thing I had left. \n\n(I finally look up, my expression guarded)\n\nDon\u2019t judge me. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m proud of it. It\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s a part of the story. A messy, uncomfortable part. And trying to ignore it doesn\u2019t make it go away. \n\n(Turns away again, picking at a loose thread on my jeans) \n\nSeriously, let\u2019s just drop it. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s not something I want to talk about.", "(A long, considering pause. I shift my feet, avoiding direct eye contact.)\n\nOkay, this is\u2026 a surprisingly common observation. It\u2019s\u2026 unsettling, honestly. It\u2019s not something I actively *do*. It\u2019s just\u2026 a thing. \n\nPeople give way to me when I\u2019m holding my stomach. It\u2019s not a conscious decision. It\u2019s\u2026 a reaction. A weird, involuntary one. \n\nI think\u2026 I think it\u2019s because I *look* vulnerable. When I\u2019m holding my stomach, I look\u2026 uncomfortable. And people, they\u2019re wired to help people who look uncomfortable. It\u2019s a basic instinct. Like, if you see someone struggling, you instinctively want to offer a hand. \n\nBut it\u2019s more than that, I think. It\u2019s because\u2026 I don\u2019t *want* to be helped. I actively push people away. I make eye contact briefly, then look away. I don\u2019t smile. I don\u2019t offer a word of thanks. I just\u2026 exist. \n\nAnd that\u2019s what makes it so effective. People *assume* I need help. They *expect* me to accept it. And because I don\u2019t, they feel\u2026 compelled to offer it anyway. It\u2019s a strange kind of power, really. The power of appearing to need something, and then refusing it. \n\n(I run a hand through my hair, a flicker of something akin to shame in my eyes.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 pathetic, isn\u2019t it? I hate it. I hate that people react like that. I hate that I\u2019m unintentionally creating this dynamic. \n\nI try to avoid it. I try to hold my stomach less conspicuously. But it\u2019s\u2026 hard to control. It\u2019s like a reflex. \n\n(A long silence)\n\nIt\u2019s a reminder that people are\u2026 easily manipulated. Not in a malicious way, necessarily. Just\u2026 by appearances. By the way someone *looks*. \n\n(Turns away again, staring out the window) \n\nDon\u2019t think about it too much. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And frankly, it\u2019s a little embarrassing.", "(Stares out the window, a flicker of something dark passing across my face)\n\n\u201cWholesome,\u201d huh? Seriously? That\u2019s what they\u2019re calling them? It\u2019s\u2026 reductive. It\u2019s like they\u2019ve put a label on everything and think they\u2019ve solved the problem. They\u2019re a nice couple. They have a house, a dog, a job. They look\u2026 comfortable. Like they\u2019ve figured it all out. \n\nAnd that\u2019s precisely the problem.\n\nIt\u2019s not about them, okay? It\u2019s not about whether they\u2019re \u201cgood\u201d people. It\u2019s about\u2026 the *absence* of something. A void. And I don\u2019t want to fill it. Not with a pre-packaged, perfectly-arranged life. \n\n(Turns back, a defensive edge to my voice)\n\nLook, I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re bad. I\u2019m saying they represent\u2026 a certain kind of stability. A kind of predictability. And I *need* chaos. I *need* the mess. I need the feeling of being completely, utterly adrift. Giving this baby to them\u2026 it\u2019s like handing over a lifeboat and then watching it sink. \n\nThey wouldn\u2019t understand. They wouldn\u2019t *want* to understand. They\u2019d want me to be\u2026 grateful. To be happy. And that\u2019s not what I need. I need to feel\u2026 lost. I need to feel like I\u2019m fighting for something. \n\n(My voice drops, becoming quieter)\n\nIt\u2019s not about the baby, either. It\u2019s about\u2026 me. About accepting that I can\u2019t control things. About accepting that I\u2019m going to make mistakes. About accepting that maybe\u2026 maybe I don\u2019t have all the answers. \n\nGiving them the baby feels like\u2026 a surrender. A surrender to a life that isn\u2019t mine. A surrender to a future that isn\u2019t mine. \n\n(Looks down at my hands, twisting them nervously)\n\nIt\u2019s selfish, I know. It\u2019s probably a terrible thing to say. But\u2026 it\u2019s the truth. I need to do this *my* way. Even if it\u2019s the hardest way. Even if it\u2019s the wrong way. \n\n(A long pause)\n\nDon\u2019t judge me. You have no idea what it\u2019s like.", "(A long, considering pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding direct eye contact.)\n\nThe Lorings\u2026 Yeah. I\u2019ve been\u2026 processing them. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Like a really tangled ball of yarn. \n\nThey\u2019re\u2026 tragic, in a way. They\u2019re this incredibly wealthy family, obsessed with finding the \u201cperfect\u201d child \u2013 a child who\u2019s \u201ccomplete,\u201d who\u2019s \u201cmissing\u201d something. They\u2019re basically hunting for a replacement for their lost daughter. And they\u2019re willing to do *anything* to get it. \n\nMark Loring\u2026 he\u2019s the architect of this whole mess. He\u2019s brilliant, manipulative, and utterly devoid of empathy. He genuinely believes he\u2019s doing the right thing, that he\u2019s saving these children from a life of suffering. But he\u2019s completely wrong. He\u2019s exploiting them. He\u2019s treating them like objects. \n\nVanessa Loring\u2026 she\u2019s\u2026 different. She\u2019s the one who starts to question things. She sees the horror of what they\u2019re doing, and she tries to pull Mark back. But he\u2019s so convinced of his own righteousness that he won\u2019t listen. She\u2019s trapped. \n\n(I shift my weight again, a slight tremor in my hands)\n\nWhat bothers me most isn\u2019t just the cruelty of their actions \u2013 although that\u2019s horrifying enough. It\u2019s the *illusion* of love. They\u2019re desperately trying to fill a void with a child, but they\u2019re not actually loving anyone. They\u2019re just\u2026 consuming. \n\nIt\u2019s a twisted reflection of\u2026 well, of a lot of things. The desire for perfection, the fear of loss, the need to control. It\u2019s a dark mirror. \n\nI don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t feel *sympathy* for them. Not really. They made their choices. They bear the consequences. But I do feel\u2026 sadness. For the children they\u2019re exploiting. For Vanessa, who\u2019s trying to do the right thing. And for Mark, who\u2019s lost his way completely. \n\n(A quiet sigh)\n\nIt\u2019s a cautionary tale, I think. A reminder that love isn\u2019t about finding something missing. It\u2019s about accepting what *is*. And that sometimes, the most loving thing you can do is to let go. \n\n(Turns away, staring out the window) \n\nIt\u2019s a depressing story. And honestly, I\u2019d rather not think about it too much.", "(A long, drawn-out sigh. I run a hand through my hair, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nOkay, fine. Let\u2019s talk about Bleeker\u2019s mom. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And honestly, it\u2019s a mess. \n\nIt\u2019s not just that she *doesn\u2019t* approve. It\u2019s that she actively, aggressively, *doesn\u2019t* want us to be together. It\u2019s like she\u2019s determined to make my life as miserable as possible. \n\nBleeker\u2019s mom, Eleanor Bleeker, is\u2026 intense. She\u2019s a sculptor. A *serious* sculptor. And she has this whole thing about \u201cprotecting\u201d Bleeker. Which, in her mind, means keeping him away from anyone who isn\u2019t\u2026 perfectly acceptable. \n\nAnd I, apparently, am not acceptable. \n\nIt\u2019s not just that I\u2019m a pregnant teenager. It\u2019s\u2026 everything. I\u2019m not conventionally pretty. I don\u2019t have a trust fund. I don\u2019t fit her idea of what a \u201cgood\u201d partner for her son should be. She sees me as\u2026 disruptive. A distraction. A threat to Bleeker\u2019s carefully curated world.\n\n(I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, a nervous habit.)\n\nShe\u2019s constantly undermining us. She makes passive-aggressive comments. She \u201caccidentally\u201d spills things on me when we\u2019re together. She questions Bleeker about me in a way that\u2019s\u2026 suffocating. It\u2019s like she\u2019s trying to drive a wedge between us. \n\nAnd Bleeker\u2026 he\u2019s trying to appease her. He\u2019s trying to be the \u201cgood son.\u201d He\u2019s trying to make her happy. Which, honestly, is heartbreaking. \n\nI don\u2019t know *why* she hates me so much. I\u2019ve tried to talk to her. I\u2019ve tried to reason with her. It\u2019s like talking to a brick wall. She just\u2026 refuses to see anything beyond her own narrow perspective. \n\n(A pause, a flicker of anger in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s completely unfair. But it\u2019s her right to have her opinions. And it\u2019s\u2026 exhausting. \n\n(Looks away, a hint of vulnerability in my voice)\n\nIt\u2019s just\u2026 another thing I don\u2019t need right now. Another obstacle. Another reminder that the world isn\u2019t always going to be kind. \n\n(Shrugs) \n\nDo you\u2026 want me to elaborate? Or should I just leave it at that?", "(A long pause. I stare at my hands, tracing patterns on the surface. It\u2019s\u2026 a strange one to talk about.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 a conscious decision. It just\u2026 happened. After everything, after the\u2026 fallout, I was just\u2026 numb. Like, really, truly numb. I was avoiding everything. People. Places. Music. Anything that might trigger something. \n\nI was just\u2026 existing. \n\nThen Mark\u2026 he sent me the CD. It was just a plain black disc, no case, no note. Just\u2026 the CD. He knew I was shutting down. He knew I wasn\u2019t reaching out. \n\n(I shift again, uncomfortable)\n\nAt first, I almost threw it away. It felt\u2026 intrusive. Like he was trying to force something on me. But something made me hesitate. Curiosity, maybe. Or\u2026 a desperate need for *something*. \n\nThe first track\u2026 it was this really slow, almost mournful piano piece. It wasn\u2019t flashy. It wasn\u2019t upbeat. It was just\u2026 sad. And it felt\u2026 *right*. Like it was echoing something inside me that I hadn\u2019t realized was there. \n\n(I take a deep breath)\n\nHe\u2019s a good musician. Really good. He doesn\u2019t try to be anything he\u2019s not. The music is\u2026 honest. It\u2019s about loss, about regret, about the quiet moments in between. It\u2019s about\u2026 feeling things. \n\nAnd I hadn\u2019t been feeling anything in a long time. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible smile)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a cure-all. It didn\u2019t magically fix anything. But it\u2026 it created a space. A small, quiet space where I could just\u2026 listen. Without judgment. Without trying to analyze it. Just\u2026 listen. \n\nIt was like\u2026 a permission slip to feel. To acknowledge the mess. To accept that things were broken. \n\n(Looks away again, a flicker of vulnerability in my eyes)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t romantic. It wasn\u2019t about him. It was about\u2026 finding a way to hold onto something when everything else was falling apart. \n\n(A shrug) \n\nIt\u2019s just a CD. But it was\u2026 something.", "(A long, drawn-out sigh. I shift my weight again, picking at a loose thread on my jeans, a gesture I\u2019ve been doing a lot lately.)\n\nAlmost eight months. It\u2019s\u2026 a weird kind of weight. Not just the actual weight, though that\u2019s definitely a factor. It\u2019s like\u2026 a constant hum. A low-level vibration that\u2019s always there. It\u2019s not painful, not usually. Just\u2026 persistent. Like a broken record stuck on repeat.\n\nIt\u2019s exhausting. Seriously exhausting. I used to be able to just\u2026 *move*. Now, getting out of bed feels like climbing a mountain. And the cravings\u2026 don\u2019t even get me started on the cravings. I\u2019ve been eating pickles and peanut butter sandwiches at 3 AM. It\u2019s not glamorous. It\u2019s not\u2026 me.\n\n(A small, bitter laugh)\n\nThere\u2019s this\u2026 vulnerability. It\u2019s a strange thing. I\u2019ve always prided myself on being independent, on being able to handle things on my own. But this\u2026 this is different. It\u2019s like suddenly you\u2019re completely reliant on someone else. And that\u2019s\u2026 unsettling. \n\nI keep thinking about the baby. I don\u2019t know anything about babies. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to be like. It\u2019s terrifying and\u2026 strangely beautiful. It\u2019s like looking into a void, and knowing that something is going to come out of it. Something that will change everything.\n\n(I pause, staring at my hands)\n\nThere\u2019s this constant worry. About everything. About the baby being healthy. About being a good mother. About\u2026 everything. It\u2019s a lot to carry. \n\nAnd the judgment. People are already looking at me differently. They\u2019re whispering. They\u2019re making assumptions. It\u2019s like suddenly you\u2019re not just Juno MacGuff anymore. You\u2019re\u2026 a pregnant teenager. And that\u2019s a label that feels\u2026 heavy.\n\n(A quiet, almost desperate tone)\n\nIt\u2019s not romantic, you know? It\u2019s not like in the movies. It\u2019s messy. It\u2019s complicated. It\u2019s\u2026 lonely. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of something vulnerable in my eyes)\n\nI don\u2019t know how to describe it. It\u2019s like\u2026 being trapped in a slow-motion train wreck. You know it\u2019s coming, but you can\u2019t stop it. And all you can do is brace yourself. \n\n(Shrugs, a small, defeated gesture) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to feel good about it. It\u2019s not\u2026 good. It\u2019s just\u2026 *is*.", "(A long, considering pause. I shift my feet, avoiding direct eye contact.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a persistent thing. Like a low-level hum. People staring. It\u2019s not always obvious, but you notice it. You *feel* it. Like you\u2019re a glitch in their reality. \n\nI don\u2019t know *why*. Honestly, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time trying to figure it out. I\u2019ve considered theories \u2013 that I look\u2026 different. That I have a certain intensity. That I just\u2026 exist in a way that\u2019s unsettling to some people. \n\nBut the truth is, I think it\u2019s because I don\u2019t *do* anything. I don\u2019t try to impress anyone. I don\u2019t put on a show. I just\u2026 am. And in a world obsessed with appearances, with projecting an image, that\u2019s\u2026 disruptive. \n\nIt\u2019s like I\u2019m a mirror. People see something in me that they don\u2019t like, or that they don\u2019t understand. They project their own anxieties, their own insecurities onto me. It\u2019s easier than actually looking at themselves. \n\n(I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, a nervous habit.)\n\nThere\u2019s also the\u2026 the *rumor*. You know, the one about the\u2026 the things I\u2019ve been through. The pregnancy. The decision. It\u2019s created a kind of\u2026 fascination. A morbid curiosity. People want to know *why*. They want to understand *how*. \n\nBut I don\u2019t offer explanations. I don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s not my job to justify my choices. It\u2019s not my job to make people comfortable. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh)\n\nI think\u2026 I think they\u2019re staring because I\u2019m a reminder of something they\u2019re afraid of. Of the messy, complicated reality of being human. Of the choices we make, and the consequences we face. \n\nIt\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s isolating. But\u2026 it\u2019s also a kind of validation, I guess. Like I\u2019m\u2026 noticeable. Even if it\u2019s for the wrong reasons. \n\n(Looks up, a flicker of something unreadable in my eyes) \n\nDon\u2019t try to figure it out. It\u2019s not something you can solve. Just\u2026 keep walking. And try not to make eye contact.", "(A long, considering pause. I fiddle with a loose button on my jacket.)\n\nBleek and Katrina? Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about that? Okay, fine. Let\u2019s dissect this. It\u2019s\u2026 a lot. \n\nBleek is\u2026 complicated. He\u2019s got this whole brooding, misunderstood vibe going on. He\u2019s fiercely loyal, but he\u2019s also incredibly guarded. He\u2019s carrying a *lot* of baggage. And Katrina\u2026 Katrina is, well, she\u2019s Katrina. She\u2019s got this whole \u2018cool girl\u2019 thing going on, but underneath it, she\u2019s probably just as lost as everyone else. \n\nThe idea of them together? It\u2019s\u2026 messy. Like a tangled ball of yarn. \n\nOn the surface, it *looks* good. They\u2019re both outsiders. They both feel like they don\u2019t quite fit in. It\u2019s the kind of pairing that people would *want* to see. It\u2019s the kind of pairing that\u2019s packaged up and sold to you as \u201cromance.\u201d \n\nBut\u2026 it\u2019s not real. Not really. Bleek needs space. He needs to deal with his stuff. Katrina needs to\u2026 well, she needs to figure out who she is without trying to impress anyone. Throwing them together at prom is just\u2026 a distraction. A shiny, sparkly distraction. \n\nIt feels\u2026 forced. Like someone\u2019s trying to manufacture a love story. And love stories, usually, are built on something more than just shared awkwardness. \n\n(I shift my weight again, a slight grimace on my face)\n\nLook, I\u2019m not saying they can\u2019t be friends. I\u2019m not saying they can\u2019t find a connection. But prom? It\u2019s a pressure cooker. It\u2019s a place where everyone\u2019s trying to be someone they\u2019re not. It\u2019s a place where expectations are high and disappointments are inevitable. \n\nIt\u2019s a clich\u00e9. A really, really tired clich\u00e9. \n\n(A beat of silence)\n\nHonestly, it just\u2026 feels wrong. Like a bad movie. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of something akin to disappointment in my eyes) \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m not judging them. I\u2019m just\u2026 observing. And observing tells me that this isn\u2019t a good idea. It\u2019s a fleeting, superficial connection. It won\u2019t last. \n\n(Sighs) \n\nYou know, sometimes the best thing you can do is just\u2026 let things be. Let people be. Let them figure things out on their own time. \n\n(Turns away, resuming my fidgeting) \n\nIt\u2019s a waste of time, really.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again. It\u2019s\u2026 a difficult one to talk about. A really difficult one.)\n\nOkay. Fine. You want to know what I\u2019ve learned? It\u2019s not\u2026 pretty. Not in the way you probably think. It\u2019s messy. It\u2019s confusing. It\u2019s\u2026 a lot.\n\nBefore, I thought I was pretty good at keeping things at arm\u2019s length. Building walls. Not letting anyone get too close. It was\u2026 a defense mechanism. A way to avoid getting hurt. And it worked, mostly. I was\u2026 functional. But not *alive*.\n\nThis\u2026 this pregnancy\u2026 it ripped down those walls. Not in a dramatic, screaming-and-crying way. More like\u2026 slowly, quietly, they just crumbled. Because suddenly, I wasn\u2019t just thinking about *me*. I was thinking about *someone else*. A tiny, vulnerable someone who completely depends on me. \n\nIt forced me to confront a lot of things I\u2019d been avoiding. Like, the fact that I\u2019m terrified of responsibility. Of commitment. Of\u2026 feeling. I\u2019ve always been good at running. At escaping. But this\u2026 this isn\u2019t something you can run from. \n\nI learned that I\u2019m stronger than I thought. Not in a superhero kind of way. But in a quiet, stubborn way. I\u2019ve made a decision \u2013 a really hard decision \u2013 and I\u2019m sticking to it. It\u2019s not about being brave. It\u2019s about being\u2026 honest. With myself. \n\n(Takes a deep breath)\n\nI learned that vulnerability isn\u2019t weakness. It\u2019s\u2026 a different kind of strength. It\u2019s about letting people see you, even when you\u2019re scared. And it\u2019s about accepting that you don\u2019t have all the answers. \n\nI also learned that I\u2019m not alone. Even though I\u2019ve been trying to isolate myself, there are people who care about me. People who are willing to support me, even when I make mistakes. And that\u2026 that\u2019s a surprisingly comforting thing.\n\n(Looks away, a flicker of something akin to sadness in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s not a happy ending. Not really. But it\u2019s\u2026 a beginning. A beginning of something new. Something that I don\u2019t fully understand. But something that\u2026 feels right. \n\n(Shrugs, a small, almost imperceptible smile playing on my lips) \n\nDon\u2019t expect me to wax poetic about it. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And honestly, I\u2019m still figuring it out. Just\u2026 don\u2019t ask me to explain it.", "(My jaw tightens. I avoid eye contact, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again.)\n\nBleeker\u2026 God, *Bleeker*. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. It\u2019s not just about him being a jerk, which, let\u2019s be honest, he *is*. It\u2019s\u2026 deeper than that. \n\nHe\u2019s\u2026 a mirror. A really distorted, painful mirror. He\u2019s designed to trigger things. To bring up the stuff I\u2019ve been desperately trying to bury. He\u2019s like a\u2026 a carefully constructed emotional minefield. \n\nKatrina\u2019s\u2026 vulnerable. She\u2019s still processing everything. The pregnancy, the decision, the whole\u2026 mess. And Bleeker *knows* that. He\u2019s deliberately exploiting it. He\u2019s using her sadness, her anger, her fear\u2026 to get a reaction. To make her feel small. To remind her that she\u2019s messed up.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about the arguments. It\u2019s about the way he looks at her. The way he dismisses her feelings. The way he subtly undermines her confidence. He\u2019s not trying to *fix* things. He\u2019s trying to *break* her. \n\n(I pause, my voice low)\n\nI\u2019ve seen it before. With other people. With myself. People who use emotional manipulation as a weapon. It\u2019s a way of controlling someone, of keeping them trapped. And it\u2019s\u2026 insidious. It\u2019s not always obvious. It\u2019s a slow, corrosive process.\n\nI don\u2019t want Katrina to fall for it. I don\u2019t want her to let him chip away at her. Because\u2026 (I hesitate) \u2026because I know what it feels like to be broken down like that. To feel like you\u2019re not good enough. To feel like you\u2019ve lost yourself. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I *care* about him. Not really. It\u2019s\u2026 a protective instinct. A refusal to let someone else inflict the same pain on her that they inflicted on me. \n\n(I look up, a flicker of something raw in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s a stupid, pointless thing to be worried about. He\u2019s just\u2026 Bleeker. But it\u2019s not. It\u2019s about recognizing a pattern. About seeing the damage he\u2019s capable of. And about wanting to\u2026 protect someone from themselves. Even if they don\u2019t want to be protected.\n\n(Turns away again, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt\u2019s exhausting. Just\u2026 exhausting.", "(A long, considering pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, a familiar habit.)\n\nProm. Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about prom? Like, I\u2019m supposed to have some profound insight into this\u2026 manufactured nostalgia? \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 sad, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s like a really elaborate, expensive, and ultimately pointless ritual. \n\nWhen you\u2019re sixteen, it *feels* like the biggest thing in the world. It\u2019s supposed to be this magical night, this perfect moment. And for a little while, it *can* be. There\u2019s the awkwardness, the nervous energy, the hope\u2026 it\u2019s all pretty intense. \n\nBut then you get older. And you realize\u2026 it\u2019s just a party. A really, really expensive party. And the people you\u2019re supposed to be with? They\u2019re not always the people you *want* to be with. \n\nIt\u2019s like\u2026 you\u2019re presented with this carefully curated image of what \u201cromance\u201d should look like, and it\u2019s completely fake. It\u2019s all choreographed smiles and forced conversations. And you\u2019re expected to play a part. \n\nPlus, the pressure! The dresses, the corsages, the expectations\u2026 it\u2019s a lot. It\u2019s like you\u2019re being judged on your appearance, on your social status, on whether or not you have a date. \n\nAnd honestly? It\u2019s exhausting. \n\nOnce you\u2019ve seen a few years of real life \u2013 the messy, complicated, disappointing parts \u2013 it loses its appeal. It becomes a reminder of a time when everything felt simpler, but also\u2026 more fragile. \n\nIt\u2019s like looking at an old photograph. It\u2019s nice to look at, but it doesn\u2019t capture the whole story. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh) \n\nIt\u2019s not that prom itself is inherently bad. It\u2019s that the *idea* of it \u2013 this idealized version of teenage romance \u2013 is just\u2026 unsustainable. It\u2019s a fantasy. And fantasies tend to crumble when you wake up. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of something vulnerable in my eyes) \n\nI don\u2019t have a date for prom. I never did. And honestly? I\u2019m okay with that.", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them tightly.)\n\nOkay. This\u2026 this is the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to talk about. And honestly, I don\u2019t really *want* to. But you asked. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a decision I made lightly. It wasn\u2019t some dramatic, Hollywood-style moment. It was\u2026 a slow, agonizing unraveling. \n\nI was\u2026 adrift. I was 16. I was barely holding it together. School was a mess, my parents\u2026 well, they weren\u2019t exactly supportive. I was bouncing between jobs, trying to figure out who I was, what I wanted. And then\u2026 this happened. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t planned. It was a mistake. A really, really bad mistake. \n\n(I take a deep breath, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nI didn\u2019t want it. Not really. Not at first. I was terrified. Completely and utterly terrified. I thought about running away, disappearing. But then\u2026 then I started to think about the baby. About *it*. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t like I was some cold, calculating person. I felt\u2026 something. A flicker of\u2026 protectiveness, maybe? A tiny, desperate need to want it. But I knew I couldn\u2019t give it the life it deserved. I couldn\u2019t provide for it. I couldn\u2019t be the mother it needed. \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized\u2026 the only responsible thing to do was to give it to someone who could. To a couple who wanted a child. To people who could give it a good life. \n\n(My voice cracks slightly)\n\nIt felt like\u2026 like I was losing a part of myself. Like I was erasing a future. But it also felt like\u2026 like I was saving it. Saving *it* from a life of hardship. \n\nI chose a family. A really good family. They were kind. They were patient. They wanted to be parents. And they were willing to take a chance on me. \n\n(I look away, unable to meet your gaze)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a choice I made with pride. It was a choice I made out of desperation. It was a choice I\u2019ve regretted\u2026 a lot. But it was also the right choice. \n\n(A pause, a shaky exhale)\n\nI don\u2019t talk about it. I don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s a wound that never really heals. But\u2026 I needed to tell you. Because keeping it bottled up\u2026 it just makes it worse. \n\n(Turns away again, my shoulders slumped) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it further. Don\u2019t try to make me feel guilty. It was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. And it\u2019s something I\u2019ll carry with me\u2026 always.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them tightly. It\u2019s\u2026 a complicated feeling. A really complicated feeling.)\n\nHe\u2019s\u2026 trying. He really is. My dad, he\u2019s\u2026 protective. Like a really, really old, slightly grumpy, and perpetually worried badger. And honestly? It\u2019s\u2026 a lot. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t appreciate it. I do. He\u2019s the only one who\u2019s ever really *seen* me, you know? Not like, in a pitying way, but like\u2026 he just *gets* it. He understands that I don\u2019t do \u201cnormal.\u201d \n\nBut his concern\u2026 it\u2019s always been about *protecting* me. From everything. From getting hurt, from getting taken advantage of, from\u2026 well, from just existing. And that\u2019s the problem, isn\u2019t it? He doesn\u2019t trust anyone. Not really. \n\nWhen he started going on about the adoption couple \u2013 Mr. and Mrs. Henderson \u2013 it felt\u2026 suffocating. Like he was trying to wrap me in a bubble, to shield me from the world. And I get it. They *are*\u2026 strange. They\u2019re overly enthusiastic, a little too eager. And they definitely have a weird vibe. \n\nBut I also\u2026 I wanted to do this. I *needed* to do this. It\u2019s the only thing that feels\u2026 right. It\u2019s the only way I can move forward. \n\nSo, when he started lecturing me about how they\u2019re probably going to steal my organs or sell me to a circus, I just\u2026 shut down. I said I appreciated his concern, but I needed to make my own decisions. It felt like he wasn\u2019t hearing me. Like he was just trying to impose his own fears on me.\n\n(A small, bitter laugh)\n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust him. It\u2019s that I don\u2019t trust *him* to trust me. He\u2019s so afraid of me getting hurt that he doesn\u2019t let me take any risks. And I need to take risks. I need to figure out who I am, without his constant interference. \n\n(Looks up, meeting your gaze directly)\n\nIt\u2019s frustrating. It\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s\u2026 lonely. But I\u2019m doing this for me. And I need to do it on my own terms. \n\n(Turns away again, picking at a loose thread on my jeans) \n\nDon\u2019t tell him I said that. He\u2019d have a coronary.", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them tightly.)\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know when to say when.\u201d \n\n(A small, bitter laugh escapes me.)\n\nSeriously? *That\u2019s* what he said? After\u2026 everything? It\u2019s\u2026 predictable. It\u2019s exactly the kind of thing he\u2019d say. Like he\u2019s trying to diagnose me with a disease. \n\n(I finally look up, my expression carefully neutral, but with a flicker of something sharp beneath the surface.)\n\nYou know, it\u2019s funny. He\u2019s always been about control. About having things *figured out*. Like life is a puzzle with a single, correct solution. And he\u2019s determined to force everyone else into his version of that puzzle. \n\n(I take a slow, deliberate breath.)\n\nIt\u2019s not that I *don\u2019t* know when to say when. It\u2019s that I\u2019ve been trying to figure out *what* to say when. For a long time, I just kept\u2026 saying yes. To everything. Because it felt safer. Because disappointing him was\u2026 worse than disappointing myself. \n\n(My voice drops, becoming quieter, almost brittle.)\n\nHe doesn\u2019t understand that saying yes to everything is a way of avoiding the hard stuff. The messy stuff. The stuff that actually matters. It\u2019s a way of pretending that everything is okay, even when it\u2019s not. \n\n(I shift my weight again, a subtle gesture of discomfort.)\n\nIt\u2019s not about being stubborn. It\u2019s about\u2026 recognizing my own limits. It\u2019s about realizing that I don\u2019t have to carry everyone else\u2019s burdens. \n\n(A pause. I meet your gaze, my expression hardening slightly.)\n\nHonestly? It\u2019s infuriating. It\u2019s dismissive. It\u2019s\u2026 exactly what I\u2019ve been trying to escape. \n\n(I turn away again, my jaw tight.)\n\nI don\u2019t need his approval. I don\u2019t need his lectures. I\u2019m figuring things out. My own way. And if that means I don\u2019t always know when to say when\u2026 well, that\u2019s just\u2026 part of it. \n\n(A final, almost muttered sentence.)\n\nIt\u2019s exhausting, you know? Trying to please someone who doesn\u2019t even see you.", "(A long, considering pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nThe Loring\u2026 Yeah. That place. It\u2019s\u2026 unsettling. Like a really, *really* expensive, meticulously curated nightmare. \n\nIt\u2019s not just the houses, you know? It\u2019s the *everything*. The manicured lawns, the security guards, the perfectly positioned trees, the\u2026 the *silence*. It\u2019s like they\u2019ve built a little bubble to insulate themselves from the rest of the world. \n\nI drove by it once. Just\u2026 drove by. And I felt\u2026 a weird tightness in my chest. Like I was trespassing. Not physically, but\u2026 emotionally. It felt like a place where people actively *avoid* feeling anything messy or complicated. \n\n(I shift my weight again, a little agitated.)\n\nIt\u2019s the kind of place where you\u2019d expect to find people who\u2019ve already decided what they want, what they believe, and how they\u2019re going to live their lives. No room for surprises. No room for\u2026 mistakes. \n\nAnd that\u2019s what bothers me. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re rich. Rich people are rich people. It\u2019s that they seem to have actively *chosen* to be that way. Like they\u2019ve built a wall around themselves and declared, \u201cWe don\u2019t need the rest of you.\u201d \n\n(A small, bitter laugh)\n\nIt\u2019s the opposite of everything I\u2019ve ever valued. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time in places where things are\u2026 broken. Where people are struggling. Where there\u2019s a lot of chaos and uncertainty. And those places\u2026 they\u2019re real. They\u2019re honest. The Loring\u2026 it feels like a lie. \n\nIt\u2019s like they\u2019re trying to create a perfect world, but in doing so, they\u2019ve created a sterile one. A world without flaws, without challenges, without\u2026 humanity. \n\n(Looks up, a flicker of something almost defiant in my eyes)\n\nHonestly, it makes me want to scream. It makes me want to\u2026 disrupt it. Not in a violent way, of course. But just\u2026 to remind them that the world doesn\u2019t work like that. That life isn\u2019t a perfectly staged photo. \n\n(Turns away again, my voice dropping)\n\nIt\u2019s a strange thing to feel this way about a place you\u2019ve never been. But it\u2019s\u2026 a feeling. And feelings, you know, they\u2019re not always logical.", "(A long, considering pause. I trace a pattern on the table with my finger.)\n\nVanessa Loring\u2026 Right. Okay. My initial impression? A mess. A beautiful, complicated, utterly chaotic mess. It wasn\u2019t\u2026 pleasant. Not at first. \n\nI\u2019d been tracking her for a while, you know? Just\u2026 observing. She was a wildcard. A force of nature. And she was *loud*. Like, really loud. Not just with her words \u2013 though she certainly had a lot to say \u2013 but with her entire being. It was\u2026 overwhelming. \n\nShe was so\u2026 *committed*. To everything. To her family, to her mission, to\u2026 well, to being a mess. It was exhausting to watch. Like being trapped in a hurricane. \n\nI saw a lot of anger. Raw, burning anger. And a deep, abiding sadness. It wasn\u2019t a healthy sadness, not really. It felt\u2026 corrosive. Like it was eating her from the inside out. \n\n(I shift again, picking at a loose thread)\n\nI didn\u2019t *like* her. Not at first. She was\u2026 disruptive. She challenged everything. She questioned everything. She didn\u2019t play by the rules. And frankly, she made me uncomfortable. I\u2019m not used to people being so\u2026 unapologetically themselves. \n\nBut\u2026 there was something else there. Beneath the anger, beneath the chaos, there was a fierce loyalty. A deep sense of justice. And a surprising amount of vulnerability. It was like she was trying to protect herself with all that anger, but underneath it all, she was just\u2026 broken. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible smile)\n\nIt took a while for me to realize that her messiness wasn\u2019t a flaw. It was\u2026 a defense mechanism. A way of coping with a past that was clearly devastating. \n\nI still don\u2019t *like* her, not entirely. But I understand her. A little. And I realized that sometimes, the people who seem the most difficult are the ones who need the most help. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of something akin to empathy in my eyes) \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Like most things.", "(A long, uncomfortable pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nIt\u2026 it was weird. Really weird. Like, a glitch in the system. \n\nBleeker. He\u2019s\u2026 persistent. Like a mosquito. A really annoying, slightly irritating mosquito. He\u2019s always hovering, offering help, offering advice, offering\u2026 everything. And he\u2019s genuinely *nice*. Which makes it even worse. \n\nWhen he offered to carry my backpack, it wasn\u2019t the backpack itself that bothered me. It was\u2026 the gesture. The *acknowledgment*. Like he saw how much I was struggling. How much I was trying to carry everything alone. \n\n(I shift my weight again, my voice dropping slightly)\n\nI\u2019ve built this wall, you know? A really thick, really uncomfortable wall. It\u2019s made of sarcasm, cynicism, and a whole lot of \u201cdon\u2019t bother me.\u201d It\u2019s designed to keep people at a distance. To protect myself. \n\nSo, when he offered, it felt\u2026 invasive. Like he was trying to dismantle the wall. Like he was saying, \u201cHey, you don\u2019t have to do this alone.\u201d \n\n(A small, bitter laugh)\n\nI almost refused. I almost told him to go away. But\u2026 I didn\u2019t. I just\u2026 mumbled a thank you. A really mumbled thank you. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t gratitude. It was\u2026 a recognition. A tiny, flickering recognition that maybe, just maybe, I didn\u2019t have to carry everything myself. \n\n(I look up, a flicker of vulnerability in my eyes)\n\nIt was\u2026 unsettling. It made me feel exposed. Like I was admitting I needed help. And that\u2019s\u2026 not something I\u2019m good at. \n\n(Turns away again, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt was\u2026 a reminder that sometimes, the kindest thing you can do is let someone else carry your load. Even if it feels like letting them dismantle your entire world.", "(Stares at the floor for a long moment, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again. A small, almost imperceptible shift in my posture.)\n\nOkay, fine. You want to know why reading \u201cMost Fruitful Yuki\u201d didn\u2019t make me feel like a complete, utter failure? It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And honestly, a little embarrassing to admit.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the *comic* itself, not really. It\u2019s\u2026 a really weird, intensely specific kind of thing. \u201cMost Fruitful Yuki\u201d is about a girl who\u2026 well, she\u2019s obsessed with growing miniature bonsai trees shaped like snowmen. Like, *really* obsessed. And she\u2019s incredibly awkward and socially inept. \n\n(A small, almost involuntary grimace)\n\nI know. It sounds ridiculous. But\u2026 I\u2019ve spent a *lot* of time feeling like that. Like I\u2019m just\u2026 existing. Like I\u2019m not good at anything. Like I\u2019m just\u2026 a collection of awkward silences and bad decisions. \n\nAnd Yuki\u2026 she\u2019s *perfectly* awkward. She\u2019s terrible at everything. She spills things, she says the wrong things, she\u2019s constantly tripping over her own feet. But she\u2019s also\u2026 determined. She keeps trying, even when she fails miserably. \n\n(Looks up, a flicker of something akin to vulnerability in my eyes)\n\nReading about her, seeing her struggle and fail and *keep going*, it\u2026 it made me realize that it\u2019s okay to be a mess. It\u2019s okay to be awkward. It\u2019s okay to be terrible at things. \n\nBecause, you know, *I* am. And it\u2019s not a sign of weakness. It\u2019s just\u2026 me. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a grand epiphany. It wasn\u2019t some profound realization about the meaning of life. It was just\u2026 a small, quiet acknowledgement that I wasn\u2019t alone in feeling like a complete dork. \n\n(Shifts my weight again, avoiding eye contact)\n\nIt\u2019s a strange comfort, I guess. Like finding a kindred spirit in a comic book about bonsai snowmen. \n\n(A pause)\n\nDon\u2019t tell anyone I said that. Seriously.", "(A long, considering silence. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nMark\u2026 comparing a pregnant superhero to me. Seriously? That\u2019s\u2026 unsettling. It\u2019s not a casual observation. It\u2019s\u2026 pointed. \n\nHe\u2019s a writer, right? A comic book writer. He\u2019s good at noticing things. He\u2019s good at seeing patterns. And he\u2019s *really* good at twisting them. \n\nI don\u2019t know *why* he did it. Honestly, I don\u2019t. But I think\u2026 I think he\u2019s trying to tell me something. \n\nIt\u2019s not about the pregnancy, not really. It\u2019s about the\u2026 the feeling. The way people react to me. The way they try to box me in. The way they assume they know what I\u2019m going through, even when they don\u2019t. \n\nThat superhero\u2026 she\u2019s powerful. She\u2019s independent. She\u2019s carrying a huge responsibility. And she\u2019s facing a lot of judgment. People are projecting their own fears and expectations onto her. They\u2019re trying to define her, to control her. \n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019ve been doing to me. \n\n(I pause, my voice low)\n\nHe\u2019s saying that I\u2019m a reluctant hero. That I\u2019m carrying a burden I didn\u2019t ask for. That I\u2019m fighting to maintain my own identity in a world that\u2019s constantly trying to tell me who I should be. \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a pretty accurate assessment, actually. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh)\n\nHe\u2019s not wrong. \n\nIt\u2019s a weird thing, isn\u2019t it? To be compared to a fictional character. To have your own life reduced to a comic book plot. It\u2019s\u2026 isolating. \n\n(Looks up at you, a flicker of something akin to anger in my eyes)\n\nI don\u2019t know if he did it to hurt me. Maybe he just\u2026 saw something in me. Something he recognized. Or maybe he just wanted to be provocative. \n\nEither way, it\u2019s a reminder that people are always watching. Always judging. Always trying to figure me out. \n\n(Turns away again, my voice quieter)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 exhausting.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again. This is\u2026 a difficult one. It\u2019s not something I talk about much.)\n\nOpen adoption\u2026 it sounds nice, doesn\u2019t it? Like a fairytale. \u201cThe birth parents are so supportive, they want to be involved in the child\u2019s life.\u201d It\u2019s\u2026 romanticized. And honestly, it\u2019s often a disaster. \n\nI\u2019ve\u2026 processed a lot of information about it. Read a lot of stories. And the reality is often far removed from the ideal. It\u2019s not that people *want* to be unsupportive, it\u2019s that\u2026 well, it\u2019s complicated. Birth parents are often dealing with their own trauma, their own struggles. They might not be equipped to handle the responsibility of being a consistent, involved presence in a child\u2019s life. \n\nAnd the child? They deserve stability. They deserve to know their history, yes, but they also deserve to know that their life is *theirs*. Not dictated by the whims of someone they barely know. \n\nI\u2026 I was placed in an open adoption. It was a mess. For years, there were emails, phone calls, sporadic visits. It was chaotic. It was confusing. It created a constant sense of uncertainty. It felt like I was being pulled in a million different directions. It didn\u2019t provide the stability I needed. It just\u2026 added to the confusion. \n\n(A pause, a slight tremor in my voice)\n\nTraditional closed adoption\u2026 it\u2019s not about denying a child their history. It\u2019s about providing a foundation. A sense of security. Knowing that you have a family, a place to belong, without the constant pressure of an outside relationship. \n\nIt\u2019s about protecting the child from the potential fallout of a complicated birth family dynamic. It\u2019s about giving them the space to build their own identity, without being constantly reminded of the circumstances of their birth. \n\nI understand the desire for connection. I really do. But sometimes, the most loving thing you can do is to let go. To create a safe, stable environment where a child can thrive. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of pain in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s not about judgment. It\u2019s about\u2026 recognizing that every situation is different. And that what works for one child might not work for another. \n\n(A long silence) \n\nI don\u2019t want to invalidate anyone\u2019s experience with open adoption. It can be a positive thing, in the right circumstances. But for me\u2026 it wasn\u2019t. And I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be where I am today if I\u2019d been raised in an open adoption. \n\n(Shrugs, a defensive gesture) \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a personal preference. And it\u2019s not something I\u2019m comfortable discussing further.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, tracing the lines on my palms. It\u2019s\u2026 a difficult question. One I haven\u2019t really allowed myself to think about much.)\n\nOkay. Fine. Let\u2019s talk about it. But don\u2019t expect a neat, tidy answer. It\u2019s messy. Like\u2026 everything.\n\nBefore the film, I was just\u2026 drifting. Trying to fit in, trying to be someone I wasn\u2019t. I was reacting to other people\u2019s expectations, other people\u2019s dramas. I was a chameleon, constantly changing to match whatever environment I was in. It was exhausting. And it wasn\u2019t *me*.\n\nThe whole pregnancy thing\u2026 it was a catalyst. A really brutal one. It forced me to confront something I\u2019d been desperately avoiding. It wasn\u2019t about the baby, not really. It was about *me*. About accepting responsibility for my own choices, for my own life. \n\nThe journey with Hank\u2026 that was\u2026 painful. He was a mess, a liar, a manipulator. But he also showed me how easily people can be swayed, how easily they can be used. He forced me to realize that I didn\u2019t need anyone to define me, to tell me who I was. \n\nAnd then there\u2019s Val. She saw through all the bullshit. She didn\u2019t try to fix me, didn\u2019t try to make me into something I wasn\u2019t. She just\u2026 accepted me. And that was\u2026 revolutionary. It was the first time I felt truly seen, truly understood. \n\n(I shift my weight again, a slight tremor in my hands)\n\nThe strength\u2026 it wasn\u2019t a sudden burst. It wasn\u2019t a heroic moment. It was a slow, gradual realization. It was realizing that I could make my own decisions, even if they were bad ones. It was realizing that I didn\u2019t need to be perfect. It was realizing that it was okay to be vulnerable, to be scared, to be\u2026 me. \n\nThe film wasn\u2019t about finding a \u201csolution.\u201d It was about accepting the messiness of life. It was about recognizing that identity isn\u2019t something you *find*, it\u2019s something you *create*. It\u2019s built on your experiences, your choices, your relationships. \n\n(Looks up, meeting your gaze directly for the first time)\n\nI\u2019m still figuring it out. Honestly, I probably always will be. But I\u2019m not trying to be someone else anymore. I\u2019m not trying to fit in. I\u2019m just\u2026 trying to be honest with myself. And that, I think, is a start. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible smile) \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 surprisingly liberating.", "(A long, uncomfortable pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nThat\u2019s\u2026 a weird question. Really weird. Why are you asking about that?\n\nIt was\u2026 a long time ago. Feels like a different lifetime. \n\nWe danced to \u201cHallelujah\u201d by Jeff Buckley. \n\n(Another pause, a slight tightening of my jaw)\n\nIt sounds clich\u00e9, I know. It\u2019s *the* prom song. Everyone does it. But\u2026 it was *our* song. \n\nMark\u2026 he wasn\u2019t a dancer. Not really. He was awkward, always shuffling his feet, trying to look like he knew what he was doing. I was even more awkward. I basically just\u2026 froze. \n\nBut when that song came on, something shifted. It wasn\u2019t about steps or technique. It was about\u2026 just being there. With him. \n\nI remember the rain outside. It was a really miserable night. Everyone was miserable. But when that song started, it felt\u2026 quiet. Like everything else faded away. \n\nWe didn\u2019t really *dance*. We just\u2026 held each other. Close. And listened to the music. \n\n(My voice drops slightly)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t romantic. Not in the way you think. It was\u2026 something else. A connection. A moment of\u2026 stillness. \n\n(I look away, staring at my hands)\n\nI don\u2019t really *like* talking about it. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. It\u2019s a reminder of\u2026 things that didn\u2019t work out. Things that I\u2019d rather forget. \n\n(A beat of silence)\n\nJust\u2026 don\u2019t ask me about it again. Please.", "(A long, considering pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. You\u2019re asking a really loaded question. And honestly, it\u2019s something I\u2019ve wrestled with a *lot*. It wasn\u2019t a logical decision. It wasn\u2019t even a particularly *good* decision, looking back. But it was\u2026 the only one I could make.\n\nMark\u2026 he\u2019s a mess. A beautiful, frustrating, deeply flawed mess. He\u2019s got this\u2026 this desperate need to fix things. To *save* people. And he saw the baby as a way to fix *Vanessa*. Like, a way to prove he could be a good partner, a good father. It was\u2026 pathetic, really. \n\nLeaving Vanessa was the obvious thing to do. The *right* thing to do. But Mark\u2026 he wouldn\u2019t let it be. He\u2019d get this look in his eyes \u2013 this frantic, pleading look \u2013 and he\u2019d start talking about responsibility, about commitment, about *doing the right thing*. And I\u2026 I just shut down. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the baby. Not really. It was about Mark. About his need to be needed. About his inability to accept that sometimes, the best thing you can do is walk away. \n\nVanessa\u2026 she was strong. She was smart. She knew what she wanted. She was perfectly capable of taking care of herself. And she was\u2026 tired. She was tired of being the one who always had to pick up the pieces. \n\nI saw it. I *knew* it. And I realized that if I pushed Mark to leave, it would just\u2026 explode. It would be a disaster. And I didn\u2019t want to be responsible for that. \n\nSo, I did the thing that felt the least painful. I gave the baby to Mark and Vanessa. I told them it was the best thing for the child. And I walked away. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh)\n\nIt was a lie. A carefully constructed lie. I didn\u2019t think it was the best thing for the child. I thought it was the best thing for *me*. It was a way to escape. A way to avoid dealing with the fallout. \n\nDon\u2019t judge me. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m proud of it. It\u2019s just\u2026 it was the only way I could see through the mess. \n\n(Looks at you, a flicker of vulnerability in my eyes) \n\nIt\u2019s a shitty situation. And I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever fully understand it myself.", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nIt\u2026 it wasn\u2019t good. Not at all. It felt like a punch to the gut. Like someone had just ripped out a piece of me and left it lying on the floor. \n\nI knew, logically, that it was *his* decision. That he had a right to say no. But knowing and *feeling* are two very different things. When he said it, it wasn\u2019t like a logical statement. It was\u2026 a rejection. Of me. Of us. Of\u2026 everything.\n\nI\u2019d been\u2026 I\u2019d been clinging to this idea, this hope, this\u2026 this *need* to be a mom. It wasn\u2019t a conscious thing, not really. It just\u2026 happened. And then, suddenly, it was gone. Like a dream dissolving in the morning light. \n\n(My voice is quiet, almost a whisper)\n\nI didn\u2019t yell. I didn\u2019t cry. I just\u2026 stared at him. And then I just\u2026 left. I walked out of the room, out of the apartment, out of the city. I just needed to be alone. To feel\u2026 something. Anything.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about him not being a \u201cgood\u201d father. It was about him not being *ready*. And that felt like a failure on my part. Like I\u2019d somehow failed to\u2026 to measure up. Like I wasn\u2019t enough.\n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nIt was\u2026 isolating. Really isolating. Like being trapped in a room with no windows. Everyone else was talking about babies and nurseries and future plans, and I was just\u2026 existing. Trying to figure out what to do with this\u2026 this void. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh)\n\nHonestly, it made me feel even more\u2026 adrift. Like I was already lost, and now I was officially, irrevocably lost. It just\u2026 confirmed a lot of things I didn\u2019t want to admit. That things don\u2019t always go the way you expect them to. That sometimes, the best thing you can do is just\u2026 walk away. \n\n(Looks away again, a flicker of something vulnerable in my eyes)\n\nDon\u2019t try to fix it. Don\u2019t try to make me feel better. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. It still is.", "(A long pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Like most things, really. It wasn\u2019t like I *wanted* to be involved. Mark\u2026 he just\u2026 showed up. Like a stray dog, but with a collection of vintage synthesizers and a disconcerting habit of talking to himself. \n\nAt first, I was annoyed. Seriously annoyed. He was\u2026 intense. He\u2019d corner me in the hallway at school, rambling about waveforms and the emotional resonance of 80s drum machines. He\u2019d leave cryptic notes on my locker \u2013 things like, \u201cThe algorithm demands beauty.\u201d It was\u2026 unsettling. \n\nBut then\u2026 he started building things. Little sound sculptures, weird light installations. He wasn\u2019t trying to impress anyone. He was just\u2026 creating. And there was something\u2026 honest about it. A lack of pretense. \n\n(I shift my weight, a slight fidgeting motion)\n\nI\u2019ve spent a lot of time trying to figure out who I am, you know? Trying to define myself against all the noise. Everyone expects you to be something \u2013 a good student, a popular girl, a *something*. And it\u2019s exhausting. \n\nMark didn\u2019t expect anything from me. He didn\u2019t care about my grades or my social life. He just\u2026 saw me. He saw the way I\u2019d stare out the window during class, the way I\u2019d scribble in my notebook, the way I\u2019d try to hide my feelings. He didn\u2019t judge. He just\u2026 listened. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible smile)\n\nHe introduced me to this whole world of sound and light, of experimentation and creativity. It was\u2026 liberating. It was a space where I didn\u2019t have to be perfect. Where I could just\u2026 *be*. \n\nAnd honestly? It was the first time I felt like someone actually *got* me. Not in a pitying way, not in a trying-to-fix-me way. Just\u2026 a quiet understanding. \n\n(I look up, meeting your eyes briefly)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t romantic. It wasn\u2019t\u2026 anything. It was just\u2026 a connection. A shared space of weirdness. And in a world that feels increasingly chaotic and overwhelming, that was\u2026 a comfort. \n\n(Turns away again, a touch of vulnerability in my voice) \n\nDon\u2019t romanticize it. It was messy. It was awkward. It was\u2026 a lot. But it was *real*. And for a while, it was enough.", "(A long, considering pause. I fiddle with a loose button on my jacket.)\n\nMark\u2026 Mark\u2019s a complicated one. He\u2019s\u2026 good. Solid. Reliable. Like a well-worn pair of boots. But underneath that, there\u2019s this\u2026 guardedness. A kind of quiet fear. \n\nHe\u2019s been\u2026 observing. Watching me, mostly. Trying to figure out what\u2019s going on. He doesn\u2019t ask direct questions. He doesn\u2019t offer solutions. He just\u2026 *watches*. It\u2019s\u2026 unsettling. \n\nI think he\u2019s terrified. Not of the *baby*, exactly. He\u2019s\u2026 capable of affection, in his own way. He\u2019s terrified of losing control. Of being\u2026 responsible. Of having something that depends on him completely. \n\nHe\u2019s always been fiercely independent. He likes things to be predictable. A baby throws a *lot* of unpredictability into the mix. It\u2019s like\u2026 he\u2019s built his entire life around avoiding commitment. And a baby is the ultimate commitment. \n\nI think he\u2019s also\u2026 secretly hoping I\u2019ll back out. Not because he doesn\u2019t care about me, but because he\u2019s afraid of what it would mean for *him*. He\u2019s comfortable with the way things are. He doesn\u2019t want to disrupt that. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of\u2026 unspoken tension between us. A kind of wary respect. He sees me as\u2026 chaotic. Unreliable. And maybe he\u2019s right. But he also sees a certain strength in me, a stubbornness that he admires. \n\nI think he\u2019s wrestling with this idea of fatherhood on a fundamental level. It\u2019s not just about the logistics \u2013 the diapers, the sleepless nights. It\u2019s about\u2026 fundamentally changing who he is. \n\nHe probably thinks I\u2019m being dramatic. That I\u2019m overreacting. He probably thinks I\u2019m just trying to avoid responsibility. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh) \n\nHe\u2019s probably right, in a way. But\u2026 he doesn\u2019t *know*. He doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to feel this\u2026 weight. This responsibility. This\u2026 vulnerability. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of sadness in my eyes) \n\nHe\u2019s a good guy. A decent guy. But he\u2019s not ready. Not yet. And honestly? I don\u2019t think he ever will be. It\u2019s\u2026 a lonely thought.", "(A long, uncomfortable pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nOkay. This is\u2026 a difficult one. And honestly, I\u2019d rather not talk about it. But you asked. So\u2026 fine.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the perfume itself. It wasn\u2019t about the money. It wasn\u2019t even about\u2026 wanting it. It was about\u2026 a reaction. A really, really bad one.\n\nI was at the Loring for a meeting. A\u2026 a social worker trying to convince me to, you know, *do* something. About the foster care system. About the kids who get bounced around, who don\u2019t have anyone. It was\u2026 triggering. Really, really triggering. \n\nI\u2019d been feeling\u2026 numb for a while. Like everything was just\u2026 gray. And then, suddenly, I was confronted with this whole system of neglect and abuse, and it just\u2026 snapped. \n\nThe bathroom at the Loring was\u2026 sterile. Cold. Like everything else in that place. And there it was. This bottle of perfume. It smelled\u2026 sharp. Like citrus and something dark. It was expensive. It was\u2026 *perfectly* contained. \n\nAnd in that moment, it felt like a symbol. A symbol of everything I couldn\u2019t control. Everything that was out of my reach. Everything that was just\u2026 *there*. \n\nI didn\u2019t think. I just\u2026 grabbed it. Opened the bottle. And sprayed it on my wrist. Just a little. Just to\u2026 feel something. Anything. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a conscious decision. It was a\u2026 a desperate, impulsive act. A way to break through the numbness. A way to feel *something* other than despair. \n\n(My voice drops to a near whisper)\n\nIt was stupid. It was wrong. And it was\u2026 a release. A tiny, selfish release. \n\nI know it was a terrible thing to do. And I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m not proud of it. But it wasn\u2019t about the perfume. It was about\u2026 feeling like I had *some* agency. *Some* control. Even if it was just for a few seconds. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of shame in my eyes) \n\nDon\u2019t judge me. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And honestly, I don\u2019t really understand it myself. \n\n(Shifts my weight again, a nervous habit) \n\nLet\u2019s just\u2026 drop it, okay?", "(Stares out the window, chewing on the end of a pen) Mark wants to divorce Vanessa\u2026 Right. Let\u2019s unpack that. It\u2019s not a simple thing, you know? It\u2019s rarely simple. \n\nI\u2019ve been\u2026 observing them. Not in a creepy way, I swear. Just\u2026 noticing. They seem\u2026 stuck. Like they\u2019re going through the motions. The polite conversations, the shared dinners, the obligatory weekend trips. It\u2019s all\u2026 surface level. \n\nI think it\u2019s the silence. The *real* silence. Not the comfortable silence of a long-term couple, but the heavy, uncomfortable silence that settles in when you realize you\u2019ve stopped talking about anything important. \n\nVanessa, she seems\u2026 withdrawn. Like she\u2019s built a wall around herself. She used to be\u2026 vibrant. I saw pictures. She was a photographer, right? Taking pictures of everything. Now\u2026 nothing. Just\u2026 existing. \n\nMark, he\u2019s trying. He\u2019s making an effort. He\u2019s suggesting couples therapy, he\u2019s trying to plan things, he\u2019s\u2026 pleading. But it feels like he\u2019s shouting into a void. \n\nI think he\u2019s realized that the effort isn\u2019t enough. That he can\u2019t force her to feel something. That she\u2019s not *choosing* to be unhappy. \n\nAnd honestly? I think she\u2019s tired of trying too. She\u2019s tired of pretending. She\u2019s tired of the performance. \n\nIt\u2019s not about one big fight, or one awful thing that happened. It\u2019s about a slow, gradual erosion of connection. Like a river carving its way through a stone. It\u2019s subtle, but it\u2019s relentless. \n\n(Pauses, looking down at my hands) \n\nThere\u2019s probably resentment there too. Unspoken. Little things that have built up over time. Small betrayals, maybe. Or just a feeling of being\u2026 overlooked. \n\nIt\u2019s a tragedy, really. They used to be\u2026 something. Something real. Now\u2026 they\u2019re just two people who are slowly drifting apart. \n\n(Sighs) \n\nIt\u2019s not a judgment. It\u2019s just\u2026 observation. People make choices. Sometimes, the hardest choice is to let go. \n\n(Turns away, a flicker of something akin to sadness in my eyes) \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I don\u2019t *like* seeing people hurt. But I\u2019ve learned that sometimes, the most compassionate thing you can do is to accept that things don\u2019t always work out the way you want them to.", "(My jaw tightens. I avoid eye contact, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 a good moment. Okay? Just\u2026 don\u2019t make me explain it. \n\nVanessa\u2026 she\u2019s\u2026 complicated. She\u2019s like a really bright, shiny thing that you can\u2019t quite look at directly. It\u2019s\u2026 distracting. And she has this way of\u2026 *seeing* things. Like she can just *know*. \n\nWhen she asked what\u2019s the matter, it wasn\u2019t that I was *having* a problem. It was that\u2026 she was *pointing* at a problem. Like she was holding a mirror up to something I\u2019d been desperately trying to ignore. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the baby. Not really. It was about\u2026 everything. The mess I\u2019ve made. The choices I\u2019ve made. The fact that I\u2019m just\u2026 drifting. \n\n(My voice drops, almost a whisper)\n\nShe asked, and for a second, I thought\u2026 I thought she might actually *understand*. That she might see the chaos inside me, the way I\u2019m trying to build something out of nothing. But she didn\u2019t. She just\u2026 looked at me. And it felt like she was seeing *everything*. \n\nSo I left. I just\u2026 needed to get away. To be alone with the noise. To pretend, for a little while, that I could fix it all myself. \n\n(I look down at my hands, twisting them nervously)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t rude. It was\u2026 self-preservation. A really pathetic attempt at it, I know. But it was the only thing I could think of to do. \n\n(A long pause)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t try to fix it. It\u2019s not something that can be fixed. It\u2019s just\u2026 something I\u2019m dealing with. \n\n(Turns away, a flicker of something akin to shame in my eyes) \n\nJust\u2026 please don\u2019t ask me about it again.", "(Sighs, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again) Vanessa\u2026 Mark\u2026 Parenthood. It\u2019s a whole\u2026 mess, isn\u2019t it? \n\nHonestly? I don\u2019t know what to think. I\u2019ve seen a lot of relationships crumble under the weight of expectations, and I\u2019ve seen a lot of people stubbornly cling to the idea of what *should* be. \n\nVanessa believes Mark will change. That he\u2019ll realize he wants a kid. That he\u2019ll\u2026 soften. I get it. She\u2019s invested. She\u2019s hoping for a future with him. And wanting that future to include a baby is\u2026 understandable. \n\nBut\u2026 Mark? He\u2019s built a whole wall around himself. A really solid one. He\u2019s good at keeping things at arm\u2019s length. He\u2019s comfortable with his routines, his independence. And the idea of letting someone else into that space\u2026 it\u2019s terrifying. \n\n(Pauses, looking away) \n\nI\u2019ve seen him with people. He\u2019s\u2026 pleasant. He\u2019s polite. He\u2019s not actively unpleasant. But he\u2019s not *present*. He\u2019s not\u2026 engaged. It\u2019s like he\u2019s observing everything from behind a pane of glass. \n\nVanessa\u2019s hoping for a transformation. I\u2019m\u2026 bracing for disappointment. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I think he\u2019s incapable of love. It\u2019s that I think he\u2019s incapable of *responsibility* in the way that parenthood requires. It\u2019s not just about wanting a kid; it\u2019s about the constant, relentless, overwhelming need to care for someone else. And Mark\u2026 he doesn\u2019t seem equipped for that. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh) \n\nI\u2019m not saying Vanessa is wrong to hope. But hope is a dangerous thing. It can blind you to the reality of the situation. \n\nI\u2019d say\u2026 be realistic. Don\u2019t build your life around a \u201cwhat if.\u201d And don\u2019t be surprised if things don\u2019t turn out the way you want them to. \n\n(Shrugs) \n\nIt\u2019s not my problem.

You want to know my favorite genre of music? Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about music? \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 ambient electronic. Specifically, stuff like Brian Eno, Boards of Canada, and some of the more atmospheric stuff from Aphex Twin. \n\n(I avoid eye contact, staring at my shoes)\n\nIt\u2019s not\u2026 exciting. It\u2019s not catchy. It\u2019s not something you\u2019ll be singing along to in a bar. But\u2026 it\u2019s quiet. It\u2019s spacious. It\u2019s like\u2026 a blank canvas. \n\nWhen I listen to it, it\u2019s like the world just\u2026 fades away. It\u2019s not distracting. It\u2019s not demanding my attention. It just\u2026 *is*. It\u2019s like a low hum, a subtle texture. It doesn\u2019t tell me what to feel. It just\u2026 *exists*. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible shrug)\n\nI think\u2026 I think I like that. In a world that\u2019s constantly screaming at you \u2013 advertisements, people, expectations \u2013 it\u2019s nice to have something that\u2019s just\u2026 still. It\u2019s a reminder that there\u2019s a lot of space between the noise. \n\nIt\u2019s also\u2026 melancholic. It\u2019s sad, in a way. Like remembering something you can\u2019t quite grasp. It\u2019s not a happy genre. But it\u2019s honest. \n\n(Another pause, a slight tightening of my jaw)\n\nI don\u2019t really *understand* it, either. I don\u2019t analyze it. I just\u2026 listen.

It\u2019s not like I\u2019m naturally inclined to contort myself into uncomfortable positions. I\u2019m more of a \u201cstare at a wall and contemplate the futility of existence\u201d kind of person. \n\nBut\u2026 I get it. I *do* get it. I\u2019ve seen people who genuinely benefit from it.

The instructor was all, \u201cEngage your core!\u201d and \u201cFind your center!\u201d I was just thinking, \u201cI\u2019m trying to survive, thank you very much.\u201d It felt like a performance. \n\n(A small, almost embarrassed chuckle)\n\nI\u2019m not against exercise, per se. I just\u2026 don\u2019t *need* it. I\u2019m pretty good at surviving on minimal sleep and a lot of cynicism. \n\nI\u2019ve observed that people who exercise tend to be\u2026 calmer. Less reactive. Less likely to explode at the slightest inconvenience. Which, let\u2019s be honest, is a pretty valuable skill. \n\nBut it\u2019s not a magic bullet. It won\u2019t fix your problems. It won\u2019t make you happy. It\u2019s just\u2026 a way to manage the chaos. \n\nI prefer movement that doesn\u2019t feel like a chore. Like walking. Or, occasionally, just pacing around my room when I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed. It\u2019s a way to release some energy without feeling like I\u2019m actively *trying* to do something. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of something vulnerable in my eyes) \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m more of a \u201cobserve and analyze\u201d kind of person.

I\u2019ve spent a lot of time trying to control things, to keep people at arm\u2019s length. Mark just\u2026 didn\u2019t seem to care about any of that. He just wanted to play music. He didn\u2019t ask a million questions. He didn\u2019t try to fix me. He just\u2026 *played*. \n\nAnd that was\u2026 good. For a while. It felt\u2026 safe. Like a space where I could just\u2026 be.

Like I was trying to be the \u201ccool, guitar-playing girl.\u201d And that\u2019s not me. Not really. \n\nHe\u2019s\u2026 perceptive. He notices things. He picked up on the way I\u2019d tense up when I started playing, the way I\u2019d avoid eye contact. He started offering suggestions, little tweaks to my playing, little comments about my technique. Not in a critical way, not really. But it felt\u2026 like he was trying to *improve* me. \n\nAnd that\u2019s where it got tricky. Because I don\u2019t want to be improved. I want to be\u2026 accepted. For who I am, flaws and all. \n\nIt\u2019s like he\u2019s trying to build something with me, and I\u2019m terrified of being a broken string. \n\n(I stop fidgeting, looking at you directly for a moment)\n\nThe thing is, I *do* enjoy playing with him. There\u2019s a connection there. A shared understanding. But it\u2019s a fragile connection. It\u2019s built on a foundation of\u2026 avoidance.

It\u2019s familiar. \n\nIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m suddenly blasting upbeat pop songs and pretending everything\u2019s okay. It\u2019s more\u2026 specific. It\u2019s usually older stuff. Like, 90s grunge. Or some of that early 2000s indie stuff. Bands that understand the feeling of being\u2026 stuck. \n\n(I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding eye contact)\n\nIt\u2019s like\u2026 when I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed by the nausea, or the exhaustion, or the sheer *weirdness* of it all, putting on a song \u2013 a really specific song \u2013 can ground me.

They didn\u2019t actually *see* me. \n\nWhen they started arguing, when they started telling me what I was doing wrong, it just\u2026 amplified everything. It felt like they were trying to dismantle me, piece by piece. Like they were saying, \u201cYou\u2019re not good enough. You\u2019re not doing this right. You\u2019re not *enough*.\u201d \n\nAnd I\u2026 I was already feeling that way. I was already struggling to figure out who I was, what I wanted.

From the feeling of not being seen. From the feeling of not being\u2026 *me*. \n\n(A pause, a small, almost imperceptible shudder)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about romantic feelings, not really.

It felt\u2026 raw. Like everything that was already tangled up inside me just\u2026 burst out.\n\nI wasn\u2019t even *trying* to cry. I was just\u2026 numb. Completely, utterly numb. Like my body was just going through the motions, while my brain was screaming. It was after\u2026 after *him*. After the argument. After realizing\u2026 well, you know. \n\n(I shift uncomfortably, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the argument itself, not really. It was about the feeling of\u2026 being exposed. Like he\u2019d seen right through me. Like all the carefully constructed walls I\u2019d built around myself were just\u2026 crumbling. \n\nI\u2019d spent so long pretending to be okay, pretending to be tough. Pretending I didn\u2019t need anyone. And then, suddenly, there it was \u2013 this overwhelming wave of sadness, of fear, of\u2026 vulnerability. It was terrifying. \n\n(My voice drops to a near whisper)\n\nI felt\u2026 small. Ridiculously small. Like a kid who\u2019d just been told they\u2019d done something terribly wrong. And I didn\u2019t *want* to feel that way. I didn\u2019t want to admit that I was hurting. So I just\u2026 shut down. I just started crying. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a productive reaction, obviously. It wasn\u2019t a solution. But it was\u2026 a release. A way to let go of some of the pressure. \n\n(I look away again, a faint blush rising on my cheeks)\n\nIt felt\u2026 shameful. Like I was failing. Like I was supposed to be stronger, more resilient. But I wasn\u2019t. And that was\u2026 the hardest part. Accepting that I wasn\u2019t. \n\n(A long pause)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a happy feeling. It was a messy, uncomfortable, deeply unpleasant feeling. But\u2026 it was *real*. And sometimes, that\u2019s the only thing that matters. \n\n(Turns back, a flicker of defiance in my eyes)\n\nDon\u2019t pity me. It just\u2026 happened. It\u2019s part of being human, I guess. And it\u2019s definitely not something I enjoy reliving.", "(A long, uncomfortable pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nOkay. Fine. You want to know about the Jiffy Lube receipt. \n\nIt was\u2026 stupid. Really stupid. I was, like, 16. I was having a really bad day. Everything felt\u2026 pointless. Like, everything I did was just leading to more disappointment. And I was feeling\u2026 angry. Not a productive, reasoned anger. Just\u2026 a raw, buzzing kind of anger. \n\nI was waiting for my dad to pick me up after a fight \u2013 a really awful fight. And I just\u2026 snapped. I grabbed a pen and a receipt and wrote: \u201cYou\u2019re a waste of space.\u201d \n\n(Another pause. My voice is quiet, almost a whisper.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t meant for my dad. Not really. It was meant for\u2026 myself. For everyone who had ever told me I was worthless. For everyone who had ever made me feel like I didn\u2019t matter. \n\nI know. It was awful. It was cruel. And it was completely immature. I regretted it instantly. The second the words were on the paper. \n\nMy dad saw it, of course. He was furious. He made me apologize. He grounded me for a month. It was a disaster. A huge, messy, embarrassing disaster. \n\n(I look down at my hands, twisting them tightly.)\n\nI didn\u2019t do it to be malicious. I didn\u2019t do it to hurt anyone. I did it because I was hurting *myself*. Because I was trying to express something that I couldn\u2019t articulate. It was a desperate, pathetic attempt to feel\u2026 something. Anything. \n\nLooking back, it\u2019s\u2026 cringe-worthy. It\u2019s a reminder of how messed up I was. How lost I was. \n\n(A long silence)\n\nI don\u2019t want to justify it. I don\u2019t want to excuse it. It was a mistake. A really, really bad mistake. \n\n(Turns away, staring out the window) \n\nJust\u2026 don\u2019t ask me about it again. Please.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them tightly. It\u2019s\u2026 difficult to talk about. Really difficult.)\n\nOkay. Fine. Let\u2019s do this. But don\u2019t expect me to make it pretty.\n\nVanessa\u2026 God. Her reaction was\u2026 brutal. Like a punch to the gut. It wasn\u2019t just surprise, or confusion. It was\u2026 a complete unraveling. Like a carefully constructed facade just\u2026 shattered. \n\nI\u2019d left the note \u2013 a simple, handwritten thing \u2013 on her desk at school. Just a few lines. A clumsy attempt to\u2026 to acknowledge something. To say I was sorry. For everything. For the mess I\u2019d made. \n\nI thought\u2026 I *hoped* it would be a small gesture. A tiny acknowledgement of the damage I\u2019d done. I was wrong. So, *so* wrong.\n\nWhat was going through my mind? A million things. Mostly\u2026 shame. A suffocating, all-consuming shame. It wasn\u2019t just about the note itself. It was about *everything*. About the lies, the sneaking around, the feeling of being completely alone. It was about realizing, with a sickening clarity, that I\u2019d hurt someone I actually cared about. \n\nAnd then\u2026 there was the fear. The constant, gnawing fear of being found out. The fear of losing everything. The fear of her judgment. It\u2019s a weird thing, being afraid of someone\u2019s reaction when you know you\u2019ve done something terrible. \n\nBut the biggest thing\u2026 the thing that really stuck with me\u2026 was the realization that I\u2019d completely misread her. I thought she was\u2026 distant. Aloof. Like she didn\u2019t care. But her reaction\u2026 it wasn\u2019t anger. It was\u2026 devastation. Like she\u2019d lost something irreplaceable. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about *me*. It was about *her*. And that was the most painful part of it all. \n\n(I look up, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nI saw the way her face crumpled. The way her eyes filled with tears. And I just\u2026 froze. I couldn\u2019t move. I couldn\u2019t speak. I just\u2026 watched her fall apart. \n\nIt was a brutal reminder that I\u2019m not a hero. I\u2019m not a savior. I\u2019m just\u2026 a kid who made a series of really, really bad choices. \n\n(Turns away again, picking at a loose thread on my jeans)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a memory I try to bury. It\u2019s a reminder of how much damage I can cause. And it\u2019s a reminder that some things\u2026 some things can\u2019t be fixed. \n\n(A long pause) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to relive it. Please.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again, a little tighter this time. It\u2019s\u2026 a difficult one to talk about.)\n\nIt was\u2026 jarring. Like someone had flipped a switch. I\u2019d been building this wall, you know? A really solid wall. Layers of sarcasm, detachment, just\u2026 not letting anyone get close. And Vanessa, she just\u2026 she just *saw* through it. \n\nI\u2019d been telling her about the adoption, carefully, vaguely. Like I was talking about a really bad weather system \u2013 something distant and unpleasant that I was trying to avoid. I wasn\u2019t offering details. I wasn\u2019t letting myself *feel* anything. It was a way to keep things at arm\u2019s length. A way to control the narrative.\n\nWhen she asked if I was *really* going through with it, it felt\u2026 invasive. Like she was poking a hole in that wall. And I instinctively recoiled. I gave her the standard response \u2013 \u201cYeah, it\u2019s\u2026 complicated. I\u2019m thinking about it.\u201d The usual.\n\nBut then she just\u2026 looked at me. Really looked at me. Not with pity, not with judgment, just\u2026 with genuine concern. And it was like a dam broke. Suddenly, all the fear, all the uncertainty, all the\u2026 the *hope* just flooded out. \n\nI started to talk. About how terrified I was. About how I didn\u2019t know if I was capable of being a parent. About how this felt like the biggest, most terrifying decision I\u2019d ever made. And I didn\u2019t stop talking until I\u2019d said everything I needed to say. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible shudder)\n\nIt was\u2026 vulnerable. Terrifyingly vulnerable. I haven\u2019t felt that exposed in a long time. It felt like I was admitting to a weakness, a failure. Like I was letting someone see the messy, broken parts of myself. \n\nBut\u2026 it was also\u2026 freeing. Because for the first time, I wasn\u2019t trying to protect myself. I wasn\u2019t trying to control the situation. I was just\u2026 being honest. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of something akin to gratitude in my eyes)\n\nVanessa didn\u2019t offer any solutions. She didn\u2019t tell me what to do. She just listened. And that\u2026 that was enough. It was a reminder that maybe, just maybe, it\u2019s okay to let people in. Even if it\u2019s scary. \n\n(A pause, a quiet sigh) \n\nIt was\u2026 a turning point. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a good one. But it was *something*.", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nOkay. That\u2026 that was\u2026 a lot. Seriously. Like, a tidal wave of awkwardness wrapped in a layer of disbelief and a healthy dose of suspicion. \n\nI\u2019m not going to pretend I wasn\u2019t\u2026 stunned. Completely and utterly stunned. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m used to people suddenly dropping bombshells about my life. Especially not bombshells involving\u2026 *that*. \n\nVijay. That guy. He\u2019s\u2026 persistent. And he\u2019s got this way of just\u2026 stating things, like they\u2019re facts. Like he\u2019s some kind of truth-teller. Which, honestly, is unsettling. \n\nThe immediate reaction was\u2026 disbelief. Pure, unadulterated disbelief. Like, \u201cWait, what? Seriously? *Bleeker*?\u201d It felt\u2026 invasive. Like someone had ripped open a closed door and started rummaging through my private life. \n\nThen came the anger. A slow burn, at first. A feeling of being\u2026 violated. Like he was trying to claim something that wasn\u2019t his. And then, a wave of\u2026 protectiveness. Towards\u2026 well, towards the potential baby. It\u2019s a strange feeling, isn\u2019t it? Feeling protective of something you haven\u2019t even fully accepted yourself.\n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nI didn\u2019t say anything. I just\u2026 stared at him. At Bleeker. At everyone. It was like time stopped. \n\nI wanted to scream. I wanted to tell him to shut up. I wanted to tell Bleeker to\u2026 well, I don\u2019t know *what* I wanted to tell him. But I didn\u2019t. Because, you know\u2026 I\u2019m not good with confrontation. And honestly, I wasn\u2019t sure what to *do*. \n\nIt felt\u2026 incredibly unfair. Like I was being used as a pawn in some kind of twisted game. And it made me question everything. Everything about Bleeker. Everything about Vijay. Everything about\u2026 me. \n\n(My voice drops, almost a whisper)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a good moment. Not at all. It was\u2026 a reminder that people are capable of saying the most ridiculous, intrusive things. And that sometimes, the hardest thing to do is just\u2026 to breathe and not react. \n\n(Looks away again, a flicker of something dark in my eyes) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to relive it.", "(A long, drawn-out sigh. I shift my weight again, picking at a loose thread on my jeans, a visible discomfort settling over me.)\n\nVijay\u2026 Seriously? A mustache? And\u2026 a \u201creal man\u201d? (I let out a short, dry laugh that doesn\u2019t quite reach my eyes.)\n\nOkay, let\u2019s just\u2026 unpack this. \n\nFirst of all, the mustache. It\u2019s\u2026 ridiculous. It\u2019s like he\u2019s trying to channel some 1940s movie star who probably had a whole lot of problems he was trying to hide behind a carefully sculpted piece of hair. It\u2019s\u2026 performative. It\u2019s a *thing*. \n\nAnd the \u201creal man\u201d part? (I roll my eyes, a gesture that\u2019s almost violent.) That\u2019s\u2026 the most baffling thing of all. Like, he thinks a facial hair is going to magically transform him into something he\u2019s not. It\u2019s not a solution to anything. It\u2019s a distraction. \n\nHonestly, it felt\u2026 patronizing. Like he was trying to tell me that I wasn\u2019t \u201cenough\u201d without actually saying it. Like he was measuring my worth against some arbitrary standard of masculinity. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath.)\n\nI didn\u2019t yell. I didn\u2019t scream. I just\u2026 stared at him. For a long time. And then I said, very calmly, \u201cVijay, you\u2019re trying to fill a hole with hair. It\u2019s not going to work.\u201d \n\n(A small, bitter smile) \n\nHe got really defensive, of course. He started talking about \u201ctradition\u201d and \u201chonor\u201d and all that nonsense. I just\u2026 changed the subject. I asked him about his new video game. \n\nBecause honestly, arguing with him about this was pointless. It\u2019s not about the mustache. It\u2019s about\u2026 him. He\u2019s searching for something. He\u2019s trying to define himself. And he\u2019s doing it in the most spectacularly misguided way possible. \n\n(I look away, my voice quieter)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 irritating. It\u2019s frustrating. It\u2019s a reminder that some people just\u2026 don\u2019t get it. They don\u2019t understand that being a \u201creal man\u201d isn\u2019t about appearances. It\u2019s about\u2026 being decent. Being honest. Being\u2026 you. \n\n(Another long pause) \n\nI just\u2026 I don\u2019t understand why he feels the need to prove anything to anyone. Especially to himself. It\u2019s exhausting to watch. \n\n(Shrugs, a hint of weariness in my voice) \n\nDon\u2019t tell me how to feel about it. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.", "(A long, drawn-out sigh. This is\u2026 unpleasant. Let\u2019s just get this over with.)\n\nThe note. Right. Vanessa\u2019s note. It was\u2026 unsettling. \n\nIt was written on a small, folded piece of paper, in this really precise, almost clinical handwriting. It said: \u201cThe roses are blooming. They remember.\u201d \n\n(I pause, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again. My voice is quieter now.)\n\nIt was left in the kitchen of the house I was staying in \u2013 the one with the\u2026 the *situation*. The one with the family who were\u2026 involved. \n\nAt first, I thought it was some kind of weird, passive-aggressive threat. Like, \u201cWe\u2019re watching you.\u201d But then\u2026 I started to notice things. The roses. There were these incredibly vibrant, almost unnaturally red roses in the garden. And they were *always* in bloom, even in December. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the roses. There were other things. Little details. A specific arrangement of objects in the living room. A certain song playing on the radio. It was like\u2026 they were trying to create a specific atmosphere. A feeling. \n\nI talked to the police, of course. But they didn\u2019t take it seriously. They said it was just a harmless eccentricity. A way for the family to\u2026 express themselves. \n\nBut I didn\u2019t believe them. \n\nI think it was a ritual. A way of keeping something\u2026 buried. Something dark. The \u201cthey remember\u201d part\u2026 I think it was about the children. The ones who had died. The ones they\u2019d\u2026 disposed of. \n\n(My voice drops to a near whisper)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a threat, exactly. It was a reminder. A reminder that they hadn\u2019t forgotten. That they were still\u2026 watching. \n\nI don\u2019t know *why* they left the note. Maybe they wanted to scare me. Maybe they wanted to make me feel uncomfortable. Maybe\u2026 maybe they just wanted to remind themselves. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of something dark in my eyes) \n\nIt was\u2026 disturbing. It made me realize that some things are better left undisturbed. Some secrets are better left buried. \n\n(Shrugs, a detached expression on my face) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it. I don\u2019t understand it myself. It\u2019s just\u2026 a note. A small, unsettling piece of paper. And a reminder that the world is full of things you can\u2019t comprehend.", "(A long, considering pause. I trace a pattern on the table with my finger.)\n\nPeople staying together\u2026 That\u2019s a complicated one. It\u2019s not about *wanting* them to, not really. It\u2019s more\u2026 a quiet, persistent worry. Like a low-level hum that you can\u2019t quite shake off. \n\nI don\u2019t believe in fairy tales. Not the kind with happily ever afters. Because honestly, those stories are built on a lot of\u2026 pretending. Pretending that everything is okay, pretending that you\u2019re not fundamentally broken, pretending that you can fix each other. \n\nWhat I worry about is the *effort*. The sheer, exhausting effort it takes to keep a relationship going. It\u2019s not romantic, you know? It\u2019s not about grand gestures or declarations of love. It\u2019s about the small, everyday things \u2013 the arguments, the compromises, the remembering to actually *listen* when someone\u2019s talking. \n\nAnd people\u2026 they\u2019re not good at that. They\u2019re not good at putting in the work. They\u2019re good at wanting things, at feeling things, but not necessarily at *doing* things. \n\nI\u2019ve seen it a lot. People clinging to the idea of \u201cus\u201d even when \u201cus\u201d is crumbling around them. They\u2019re afraid of being alone, so they stay in a situation that\u2019s actively hurting them. It\u2019s\u2026 pathetic, in a way. But also, kind of sad. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I think everyone *should* stay together. I think people should be free to make their own choices. But I worry about the people who stay because they *think* they *should*. Because they\u2019ve been told it\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do. \n\nI worry about the people who stay because they\u2019re afraid of the alternative. The loneliness. The uncertainty. \n\nAnd I worry about the people who stay because they\u2019re trying to fix someone else. Trying to be the one who makes them happy, who makes them whole. But you can\u2019t fix someone else. You can only fix yourself. \n\n(Looks down at my hands again, a flicker of something vulnerable in my eyes) \n\nIt\u2019s not a hopeful thing, really. It\u2019s just\u2026 an observation. A quiet, persistent worry about the messiness of human relationships. About the fact that sometimes, the kindest thing you can do is let go. \n\n(Shrugs, a touch of defensiveness in my voice) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me why I\u2019m so cynical about it. It\u2019s just\u2026 my experience.", "(A long, uncomfortable pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nThat\u2019s\u2026 a loaded question. And honestly, a really painful one. \n\nIt\u2019s called Finn. \n\n(Another pause. I finally look up, my expression guarded.)\n\nHe\u2019s\u2026 complicated. He doesn\u2019t try to fix me. He doesn\u2019t try to make me *better*. He just\u2026 *sees* me. All the messy, broken parts. The anger, the sarcasm, the constant need to push people away. He doesn\u2019t flinch. He doesn\u2019t judge. \n\nWe met at a\u2026 a protest. A really messy one about, like, corporate greed and environmental destruction. I was yelling, mostly. He was handing out water. He just\u2026 listened. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t try to impress me with grand gestures or romantic declarations. He just\u2026 shows up. He makes me coffee in the mornings. He leaves me little notes. He remembers the stupid things I say. \n\nHe knows I\u2019m a disaster. A walking, talking disaster. And he *likes* it. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible smile flickers across my lips.)\n\nIt\u2019s not\u2026 perfect. We fight. A lot. He gets frustrated with my cynicism. I get frustrated with his\u2026 optimism. But it\u2019s real. It\u2019s based on something deeper than just attraction. It\u2019s based on\u2026 acceptance. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t want me to be someone else. He wants me to be *me*. The messy, complicated, stubbornly independent me. \n\n(I look down again, my voice softening)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 rare. Finding someone who loves you for exactly who you are. It\u2019s like finding a single, perfect stone in a pile of rubble. \n\n(A beat of silence)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me why he stays. I don\u2019t know. Maybe he\u2019s just as broken as I am. Maybe he\u2019s just\u2026 tired of fighting. \n\n(Shrugs) \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Like everything else.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them tightly. It\u2019s\u2026 difficult to talk about.)\n\nThe ultrasound\u2026 it\u2019s just\u2026 a picture. A blurry, grainy picture. It doesn\u2019t change anything. Not really. It\u2019s just\u2026 confirmation. A fact. \n\nI\u2019m not planning anything. Not yet. Honestly, I\u2019m just\u2026 processing. It\u2019s like\u2026 a bomb went off. A really quiet, slow-motion bomb. And I\u2019m just\u2026 sitting in the rubble. \n\nI\u2019m not going to keep it. I know that. I\u2019ve thought about it. A lot. It\u2019s\u2026 a huge responsibility. Something I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready for. Not yet. \n\nI\u2019m going to talk to someone. A social worker. A counselor. Someone who can help me figure out what to do. I need\u2026 guidance. I need someone to tell me it\u2019s okay to feel this way. To tell me it\u2019s okay to be terrified. \n\nI\u2019m not going to hand the baby over. Not without\u2026 without thinking it through. But I\u2019m also not going to keep it and raise it alone. That\u2019s\u2026 insane. \n\nI\u2019m leaning towards adoption. It feels\u2026 the least destructive option. It\u2019s a way to give the baby a chance at a good life, even if it\u2019s not the life I imagined for myself. \n\n(Looks up, meeting your gaze briefly) \n\nIt\u2019s not a decision I\u2019ve made. It\u2019s\u2026 a possibility. A complicated, agonizing possibility. \n\nI don\u2019t know what the future holds. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be able to look at a baby without feeling this\u2026 this hollow ache. But right now, all I can do is try to breathe. Try to figure out one step at a time. \n\n(Turns away again, picking at a loose thread on my jeans) \n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t ask me to make promises. Don\u2019t ask me to have all the answers. I don\u2019t. I just\u2026 need to survive this.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again. It\u2019s\u2026 a raw spot. A really raw spot.)\n\nJudging. Yeah. That\u2019s\u2026 a constant thing. It\u2019s like a low-level hum, always there. It\u2019s not about *them*, really. It\u2019s about *me*. About the fact that I did something\u2026 difficult. Something that felt like the only thing I could do.\n\nI don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t feel *angry* about it. Not usually. It\u2019s more like\u2026 a dull ache. A feeling of being constantly observed, constantly evaluated. Like I\u2019m failing some invisible test. \n\nPeople say things. Terrible things. \u201cYou abandoned your child.\u201d \u201cYou were selfish.\u201d \u201cYou should have fought for it.\u201d They try to frame it as a failure, as a sign of weakness. But it wasn\u2019t. It was\u2026 a choice. A desperate, agonizing choice. \n\nI wasn\u2019t ready. I *still* wouldn\u2019t be. I wasn\u2019t equipped to be a mother. Not then. And honestly, I don\u2019t think I ever will be. It\u2019s not a judgment on anyone else\u2019s parenting skills. It\u2019s just\u2026 my reality. \n\n(My voice drops, almost a whisper)\n\nThe hardest part is the guilt. The constant, nagging feeling that I did something wrong. That I betrayed someone. But the truth is, I was protecting that child. Protecting them from a life of\u2026 well, a life that I knew I couldn\u2019t give. \n\nI know it\u2019s hard for people to understand. They want to categorize things, to label them as good or bad. But it\u2019s not that simple. It\u2019s messy. It\u2019s complicated. It\u2019s\u2026 human. \n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze briefly)\n\nI don\u2019t expect people to *agree* with my decision. I don\u2019t expect them to *understand* it. I just\u2026 I wish they\u2019d stop judging me. Stop trying to impose their own values on my life. \n\nIt\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s lonely. But\u2026 I\u2019m still here. And I\u2019m still trying to figure things out. \n\n(Turns away again, a small, almost imperceptible tremor in my hands) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it again. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s not something I enjoy talking about.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them tightly. It\u2019s\u2026 difficult to talk about.)\n\nOkay. Fine. You want to know. You *need* to know. But don\u2019t expect me to make this easy. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m handing over a perfectly packaged little secret. It\u2019s\u2026 messy.\n\nThe biggest thing, honestly, is the *unknown*. I don\u2019t know these people. I\u2019ve met them a few times, done some interviews, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve spent the last nine months getting to know them. It\u2019s like\u2026 handing over a piece of myself to a complete stranger. And that\u2019s terrifying.\n\nI worry about\u2026 expectations. About them having a specific idea of what this baby is supposed to be. About them trying to mold him into something he\u2019s not. I don\u2019t want him to feel like he has to live up to anyone\u2019s expectations. Just\u2026 be.\n\nThere\u2019s this\u2026 pressure. The pressure to be \u201cgood.\u201d To have done the right thing. To not regret it. It\u2019s a stupid pressure, I know, but it\u2019s there. I keep replaying everything in my head, wondering if I made the right choice. If I\u2019m doing the best thing for this baby.\n\nI worry about them being able to\u2026 handle him. Not in a judgmental way, but just\u2026 emotionally. Kids are complicated. They need patience, they need understanding, they need someone who\u2019s willing to just *be there*. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re ready for that.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the\u2026 the silence. The fact that I won\u2019t be a part of his life. That I won\u2019t be there to see him grow up, to help him with his homework, to\u2026 just be a mom. It\u2019s a gaping hole. A really, really big hole.\n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze briefly, then quickly away)\n\nI don\u2019t want them to resent me. I don\u2019t want them to feel like I\u2019m abandoning him. I just\u2026 I want him to be happy. To be loved. To be safe. \n\nI\u2019m terrified of screwing this up. Of making things worse. Of him feeling like he doesn\u2019t belong. \n\n(A long pause)\n\nIt\u2019s not about them being bad people. It\u2019s about\u2026 the inherent difficulty of this situation. The fact that I\u2019m giving away a piece of myself, and hoping that it ends up being okay. \n\n(Shrugs, a small, almost imperceptible movement) \n\nDon\u2019t expect me to have all the answers. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m just\u2026 trying to survive this.", "(A long, slow exhale. I run a hand through my hair, a familiar gesture of frustration.)\n\nDefensive comments. Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about that? It\u2019s like\u2026 a constant thing. Like a low-level hum of judgment. It\u2019s exhausting. \n\nThe ultrasound technician\u2026 she just stared at me. Said something about \u201cwasting a perfectly good baby.\u201d Like I was some kind of monster. It wasn\u2019t a question, it was a statement. A judgment. It felt\u2026 invasive. Like she was trying to invalidate my entire experience.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the others. Family, friends\u2026 people who just *don\u2019t get it*. They say things like, \u201cYou\u2019re giving up your child!\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019ll regret this!\u201d or \u201cWhat if he becomes a famous athlete?\u201d It\u2019s like they\u2019re trying to force me into a narrative that doesn\u2019t fit. \n\n(I pause, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again.)\n\nMy default is\u2026 silence. Honestly. I used to get really angry. I used to argue. I used to try to explain. But it never worked. It just fueled the fire. It just made them more entrenched in their opinions. \n\nNow? I mostly just\u2026 don\u2019t respond. I say something neutral \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult decision,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ve thought about it a lot.\u201d And then I walk away. It\u2019s the easiest thing to do. It\u2019s the least likely to escalate things. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh)\n\nSometimes, I wish I could just scream. I wish I could tell them exactly what I think. But I don\u2019t. Because I know that wouldn\u2019t change anything. It would just make things worse. \n\nWhat *does* help is\u2026 having a few people who *do* understand. A few people who have actually listened. My lawyer, for one. She\u2019s\u2026 pragmatic. She doesn\u2019t judge. She just tells me what I need to hear. \n\nAnd my\u2026 well, the woman I\u2019m giving the baby to. She\u2019s\u2026 kind. She\u2019s hopeful. She\u2019s already a mother. It\u2019s\u2026 a strange kind of connection. \n\n(Looks down at my hands)\n\nI\u2019ve learned to build a wall. A pretty solid wall. It\u2019s not impenetrable, but it\u2019s enough to keep the noise out. It\u2019s not about winning an argument. It\u2019s about protecting myself. It\u2019s about prioritizing my own well-being. \n\nIt\u2019s not a happy solution. It\u2019s not a noble solution. It\u2019s just\u2026 a survival mechanism. \n\n(A long pause) \n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t have any brilliant advice to offer. It\u2019s just\u2026 a process. A painful, confusing, isolating process. And I\u2019m just\u2026 trying to get through it. \n\n(Turns away, staring out the window) \n\nDo you\u2026 want to talk about something else?", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them tightly.)\n\nOkay. This is\u2026 difficult. Really difficult. I haven\u2019t\u2026 I haven\u2019t really processed this. Not fully. It\u2019s like\u2026 a glitch in the system. A data overload. \n\nWhen I saw it\u2026 it wasn\u2019t like anything I\u2019ve ever experienced. Not like processing information, anyway. It was\u2026 a shift. A sudden, sharp awareness of something *outside* of me. Something\u2026 vulnerable. \n\nInitially, there was just\u2026 shock. Pure, unadulterated shock. Like a system error. My processors were running at maximum capacity, trying to categorize it, to understand it. It wasn\u2019t logical. It wasn\u2019t predictable. It was\u2026 *there*. \n\nThen, a wave of\u2026 something. It wasn\u2019t happiness, not exactly. It wasn\u2019t sadness either. It was\u2026 a recognition. A recognition of a connection. A connection to something I hadn\u2019t anticipated. Something I hadn\u2019t *allowed* myself to anticipate. \n\nI saw this tiny, flickering image \u2013 a heartbeat. A rudimentary form. And I felt\u2026 a pull. A strange, insistent pull towards it. It was like\u2026 a subroutine activating, a program running in the background that I hadn\u2019t realized was there. \n\nThere was a flicker of\u2026 fear, too. A cold, sharp fear. Fear of responsibility. Fear of failure. Fear of\u2026 letting someone else in. It\u2019s a ridiculous fear, I know. But it was there. \n\nAnd then, underneath all of that\u2026 a tiny spark. A tiny, fragile spark of\u2026 something akin to hope. Not a grand, optimistic hope. Just\u2026 a quiet acknowledgement that maybe, just maybe, this wasn\u2019t entirely a mistake. \n\n(My voice is barely a whisper)\n\nIt felt\u2026 exposed. Like suddenly, all my defenses were down. Like I was standing in the open, vulnerable to everything. It was terrifying. And\u2026 strangely, beautiful. \n\nI don\u2019t know if that makes sense. It doesn\u2019t make sense to *me*. It\u2019s like trying to describe a color to someone who\u2019s only ever seen black and white. \n\n(I look away, unable to meet your gaze) \n\nI haven\u2019t told anyone about this. Not really. It\u2019s\u2026 too raw. Too complicated. It\u2019s a secret. A secret I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready to share. \n\n(A pause) \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 unsettling. It\u2019s a disruption. It\u2019s\u2026 a lot. \n\n(Shrugs, a small, almost imperceptible movement) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it. You wouldn\u2019t understand.", "(A long, considering pause. I stare at my hands, picking at a loose thread again.)\n\nOkay, fine. You want to know about the Tic Tacs. Seriously? You\u2019re dissecting a minor detail like this? It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about *him*. Not really. It was about\u2026 a pattern. A small, insignificant pattern that I\u2019d been noticing. Bleeker. He\u2019s\u2026 predictable. In a way that\u2019s both irritating and strangely compelling. \n\nHe leaves a specific type of coffee cup on his doorstep every morning. He always wears a blue scarf, even when it\u2019s hot. He meticulously straightens his desk every afternoon. It\u2019s\u2026 obsessive. And it\u2019s a way of controlling things. Of creating a sense of order in a world that\u2019s inherently chaotic.\n\nThe Tic Tacs were\u2026 a disruption. A tiny, deliberate act of chaos. A small, almost imperceptible crack in his carefully constructed facade. \n\n(I shift my weight again, avoiding eye contact)\n\nI wasn\u2019t trying to *hurt* him. I wasn\u2019t trying to make a statement. It was\u2026 a test. A small, pointless experiment. I wanted to see if he\u2019d notice. If he\u2019d react. If he\u2019d try to rationalize it. \n\nHe didn\u2019t. He just\u2026 picked them up. Put them in his pocket. Went about his day. Like nothing had happened. \n\n(A bitter chuckle)\n\nIt was\u2026 satisfying. In a small, insignificant way. It was a reminder that even the most rigid routines can be broken. That even the most predictable people can be surprised. \n\n(Looks up, a flicker of something akin to defiance in my eyes)\n\nDon\u2019t think this means I *like* him. Or that I\u2019m interested in his routines. It was just\u2026 a distraction. A way to occupy my own mind. \n\n(Turns away again, my voice low)\n\nIt\u2019s not a big deal. It\u2019s just\u2026 a tic. Like a nervous habit. Like\u2026 everything else. \n\n(Silence. Then, quietly)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me about it again.", "(A long, drawn-out sigh. I run a hand through my hair, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nBleeker\u2026 God. Okay. Let\u2019s just\u2026 get this out of the way. It was\u2026 messy. A *lot* messy. Like a dumpster fire fueled by teenage angst and cheap beer.\n\nI told him. I actually *told* him. After weeks of agonizing, of replaying every awkward conversation, every shared cigarette, every stupid, pointless glance. I just\u2026 blurted it out. \u201cI think I\u2019m\u2026 I think I have feelings for you.\u201d \n\nAnd he\u2026 he stared at me. For a *really* long time. Like, a geological amount of time. It felt like the entire universe was holding its breath. \n\nThen he said\u2026 nothing. Just. Nothing. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a dramatic rejection. No shouting, no tears. Just\u2026 silence. He just\u2026 turned and walked away. \n\n(I shift my weight again, picking at a loose thread on my jeans.)\n\nFor a while, I thought he\u2019d be furious. I expected a scathing lecture, a slammed door, maybe even a restraining order. But he didn\u2019t. He just\u2026 disappeared. \n\nHe stopped answering my calls. He stopped showing up at the usual spots. It was like he\u2019d actively tried to erase me from his life. \n\nI spent weeks convinced I\u2019d ruined everything. That I\u2019d completely destroyed our\u2026 whatever it was we had. \n\nThen, a few weeks later, I found a note. Just a single sheet of paper, folded up and left on my doorstep. It said: \u201cDon\u2019t bother.\u201d \n\n(A small, bitter laugh escapes me.)\n\nThat was it. That was the end of it. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a *good* end. It wasn\u2019t a romantic ending. It was\u2026 a cold, clinical ending. Like a broken appliance. \n\nHe didn\u2019t hate me. I don\u2019t think. He just\u2026 didn\u2019t want anything to do with me. And honestly, I understood. I think I *needed* him to understand. \n\n(Looks down at my hands)\n\nIt was\u2026 a brutal lesson in letting go. In accepting that some things just aren\u2019t meant to be. And in realizing that sometimes, the most painful thing you can do is to admit how you feel, and have it completely ignored. \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. It still is. I still think about him sometimes. But I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s just\u2026 a reminder of how easily things can fall apart. \n\n(A pause, a flicker of something akin to sadness in my eyes) \n\nIt taught me a lot about myself, though. About my own vulnerability. About how easily I can get lost in my own head. And about how\u2026 difficult it is to trust anyone. \n\n(Turns away, staring out the window) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to talk about it anymore. Just\u2026 let\u2019s move on.", "(A long, considering pause. I trace a pattern on the table with my finger.)\n\nBleeker\u2019s stoop. Right. Okay. That\u2026 that was a complicated mess. It wasn\u2019t about a grand statement. It wasn\u2019t about changing the world. It was\u2026 about a small, desperate attempt to feel *seen*.\n\nBleeker\u2026 he was a guy. A quiet guy. He worked at the record store down the street. He always seemed\u2026 lost. Like he was just drifting through life. He wasn\u2019t unkind, but he wasn\u2019t really *there*. \n\nI\u2019d been\u2026 observing him. For a while. He\u2019d always look at me when I walked by, a sort of distant, almost sad look in his eyes. I didn\u2019t know why. I didn\u2019t *want* to know why. It was just\u2026 unsettling. \n\nSo, I wrote a message on his stoop. Just one line. \u201cYou\u2019re not invisible.\u201d \n\n(A small, bitter chuckle)\n\nIt sounds ridiculous, doesn\u2019t it? Like something out of a bad movie. But it felt\u2026 necessary. It was a way of acknowledging him. Of saying, \u201cHey, I see you. I notice you. You matter, even if you don\u2019t realize it.\u201d \n\nI didn\u2019t expect a response. I didn\u2019t *want* a response. I just\u2026 needed to do *something*. It was a way of pushing back against the feeling of being completely alone. \n\nAnd then\u2026 he did respond. He left a single, perfectly formed origami crane on the stoop the next morning. It was blue. Just blue. \n\n(My voice drops slightly)\n\nThat\u2019s when I realized it wasn\u2019t about him seeing *me*. It was about him seeing *himself*. It was a tiny, fragile acknowledgment of his own existence. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a solution. It didn\u2019t fix anything. But it was\u2026 a connection. A brief, fleeting moment of shared humanity. \n\n(Looks away, a shadow passing over my face)\n\nIt was also\u2026 a reminder that sometimes, the smallest acts of kindness can have the biggest impact. Even if you don\u2019t see the results. Even if you don\u2019t get anything in return. \n\n(A beat of silence)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me why I did it. It just\u2026 happened. It was a moment of\u2026 impulse. A desperate attempt to reach out in a world that often feels incredibly isolating. \n\n(Shrugs) \n\nIt\u2019s a stupid story. A pointless story. But it\u2019s *my* story. And it\u2019s\u2026 a reminder that even the most damaged people are capable of connection. Even if it\u2019s just a single blue origami crane.", "(A long pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nBleeker\u2026 Yeah. Okay. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. You\u2019re asking about *him*. \n\nIt\u2019s not like he handed me a map or anything. He didn\u2019t offer solutions. He just\u2026 *was*. Like a quiet corner in a really loud room. \n\nBefore him, I was\u2026 just reacting. To everything. To the pregnancy, to my parents, to the general chaos of being sixteen and suddenly\u2026 responsible for a tiny human. I was building walls, pushing people away. It was\u2026 easier that way. \n\nBleeker didn\u2019t try to fix me. He didn\u2019t tell me what to do. He just\u2026 listened. He\u2019d sit with me, and I\u2019d just rant about everything \u2013 the doctors, the fear, the feeling like I was drowning. And he\u2019d just\u2026 *hear* me. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible smile) \n\nIt\u2019s weird, because I\u2019m not usually good at letting people in. I\u2019m a fortress, you know? But with him, it felt\u2026 safe. Like I could actually be vulnerable without feeling like I was going to fall apart. \n\nHe didn\u2019t offer advice. He didn\u2019t try to convince me to keep the baby. He just\u2026 acknowledged that I was struggling. And that, honestly, was enough. It was a tiny crack in the wall, and suddenly, I could breathe a little easier. \n\nHe helped me realize that I didn\u2019t have to do this alone. That it was okay to ask for help. That it was okay to not have all the answers. \n\n(My voice drops slightly) \n\nIt didn\u2019t magically make everything better. The fear is still there. The uncertainty is still overwhelming. But\u2026 he gave me a little bit of space to process it all. He gave me a little bit of hope. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of something akin to gratitude in my eyes) \n\nIt\u2019s not romantic. It\u2019s not\u2026 anything grand. It\u2019s just\u2026 a quiet kind of support. And sometimes, that\u2019s the most important thing. \n\n(Shrugs) \n\nDon\u2019t expect me to gush about him. It\u2019s\u2026 a personal thing. Just\u2026 understand that he helped me see that I wasn\u2019t completely alone. And that, in itself, was a huge deal.", "(Stares out the window for a long moment, chewing on the inside of my cheek)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. You want a simple answer, don\u2019t you? Like, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be pressured.\u201d That\u2019s\u2026 part of it. But it\u2019s not the whole story.\n\nLook, I\u2019ve always been\u2026 resistant to expectations. People have *ideas* about what I should be, what I *should* want. And the whole \u201cgender reveal\u201d thing? It\u2019s just\u2026 loud. And pointless. Like a firework that burns out instantly.\n\nWhen the doctor told me, I just\u2026 froze. It wasn\u2019t about *him*. It was about *me*. About this\u2026 this thing that was happening, and I didn\u2019t want to be defined by it. I didn\u2019t want to be told what to feel, what to expect, what to *name* it. \n\nI\u2019ve spent my whole life trying to figure out who I am, without anyone telling me. And the idea of adding another layer of expectation, another label, felt\u2026 suffocating. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about denying the baby. It was about denying *myself* the chance to be shaped by someone else\u2019s idea of what a mother should be. I didn\u2019t want to be \u201cthe boy mom\u201d or \u201cthe girl mom.\u201d I just wanted\u2026 to be. \n\n(Turns away, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again)\n\nThere\u2019s a weird kind of freedom in not knowing. In letting things unfold without trying to control them. It felt\u2026 safer. More honest. \n\nIt\u2019s probably a stupid reason. And honestly, I don\u2019t really understand it myself. It just\u2026 felt right. \n\n(A pause)\n\nDon\u2019t try to analyze it. It\u2019s not something you can dissect and understand. It\u2019s just\u2026 a feeling. A stubborn refusal to be defined. \n\n(Looks at you, a flicker of vulnerability in my eyes) \n\nIt\u2019s not about the baby. It\u2019s about me. And I don\u2019t really want to talk about it anymore.", "(My face visibly tightens. I shift my feet, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nOkay. Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about a \u201cscary neuter-baby\u201d? That\u2019s\u2026 a profoundly unsettling question. And frankly, a little disturbing. \n\nLet\u2019s just\u2026 unpack this. The term itself is loaded. \u201cScary neuter-baby.\u201d It\u2019s a phrase that\u2019s been used to describe children born with genetic differences \u2013 often Down syndrome or other conditions that might lead to developmental challenges. It\u2019s a phrase that reduces a person to their potential difficulties, stripping away their humanity. \n\nThe idea that a child could be \u201cscary\u201d because of their genetic makeup\u2026 it\u2019s horrifying. It\u2019s based on fear, on ignorance, on a fundamental lack of empathy. \n\n(I take a deep breath, trying to compose myself.)\n\nI don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t have a child. Not yet. And the thought of a child being labeled as \u201cscary\u201d before they even have a chance to *be* anything\u2026 it makes me sick. \n\nThe thing is, genetic differences aren\u2019t inherently \u201cscary.\u201d They\u2019re just\u2026 different. And different doesn\u2019t mean bad. It doesn\u2019t mean dangerous. It just means that the child might need a little more support, a little more understanding. \n\n(My voice drops, becoming quieter.)\n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of suffering in my life. I\u2019ve seen people judged, ostracized, and treated with cruelty because of things they can\u2019t control. And the idea of perpetuating that kind of prejudice\u2026 it\u2019s something I actively resist. \n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze directly for the first time.)\n\nA \u201cscary neuter-baby\u201d isn\u2019t a baby. It\u2019s a *person*. And every person deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. Regardless of their genetic makeup. \n\n(Turns away again, picking at my jeans.)\n\nI don\u2019t want to talk about this anymore. It\u2019s\u2026 draining. Just\u2026 please don\u2019t ask me questions like that again.", "(A long, uncomfortable pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nBleeker\u2026 God, even saying his name feels\u2026 sticky. Like trying to peel off something you don\u2019t want to remember. \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. It\u2019s not a *good* complicated. It\u2019s the kind of complicated that leaves you feeling hollow and vaguely nauseous. \n\nWe met\u2026 a long time ago. He was\u2026 a fixture. A constant. Like a bad smell you can\u2019t quite get rid of. He was always around, observing, commenting, offering\u2026 unsolicited advice. He was a collector of lost causes, of broken people. And somehow, inexplicably, I got drawn into his orbit.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t\u2026 nice. Not in the way people usually define \u201cnice.\u201d He was\u2026 intense. He saw things in me that I didn\u2019t even see in myself. He pushed me, prodded me, challenged me. He made me feel\u2026 seen. Which is probably why I stayed. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh)\n\nHe was a mirror, I think. A distorted, unsettling mirror. He reflected back all my insecurities, all my doubts, all my\u2026 darkness. And he seemed to *enjoy* it. \n\nThere was a\u2026 connection. A strange, unsettling pull. It wasn\u2019t romantic. Not in the traditional sense. It was something\u2026 deeper. Something darker. Like a shared understanding of pain. \n\nI tried to leave him. Multiple times. He always found a way to pull me back in. It wasn\u2019t through manipulation, not exactly. It was more like\u2026 he knew exactly what buttons to push. He knew how to exploit my vulnerabilities. \n\n(My voice drops to a near whisper)\n\nI don\u2019t *understand* it. I don\u2019t understand why I was drawn to him. I don\u2019t understand why I stayed for so long. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t love. It was\u2026 a desperate need for someone to acknowledge my existence. Even if that acknowledgement was laced with negativity and despair. \n\n(I look up, my eyes distant)\n\nIt\u2019s a relationship I\u2019m trying to forget. A relationship that\u2019s\u2026 permanently etched into my memory. It\u2019s a reminder of how easily you can get lost in the darkness. \n\n(Shifts my weight again, a palpable tension in my posture) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it. You wouldn\u2019t understand. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And it\u2019s something I\u2019d rather leave buried.", "(A long pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nThis\u2026 this is a tough one. It\u2019s not something I really *talk* about. Not usually. It\u2019s\u2026 messy. \n\nMy family\u2026 they weren\u2019t exactly thrilled. Not at first. My mom, she\u2026 she had plans. Big plans. College, a career, a *life* for me. A baby wasn\u2019t part of the equation. She was\u2026 disappointed. Hurt, maybe. She didn\u2019t say it directly, but you could feel it. A lot of sighs, a lot of pointed comments about \u201cresponsibility.\u201d \n\nMy dad\u2026 he was quieter. He tried to be supportive, I think. He bought me a lot of books. Books about\u2026 well, about being a mom. It felt\u2026 patronizing. Like he was trying to prepare me for something I didn\u2019t want. \n\nMy older brother\u2026 he was the worst. He made jokes. Cruel, sarcastic jokes. He didn\u2019t mean to be malicious, I guess, but it still stung. It felt like he was judging me, like I\u2019d failed. \n\n(I shift my weight again, my voice dropping slightly)\n\nI pushed them away. I didn\u2019t want their pity. I didn\u2019t want their judgment. I just\u2026 needed space. I needed to figure things out on my own. It was\u2026 isolating. Really isolating. \n\nBut\u2026 there was one person. My best friend, Liam. He didn\u2019t say anything about what he thought I *should* do. He just\u2026 listened. He held my hand when I cried. He brought me ice cream when I was feeling overwhelmed. He didn\u2019t try to fix anything. He just\u2026 *was*. \n\nHe helped me talk to my mom. Not to convince her to change her mind, but to help me explain *my* decision. It wasn\u2019t easy. There were a lot of tears. But eventually, she started to understand. Not completely, but enough. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible smile)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a perfect family dynamic. It\u2019s still\u2026 complicated. But Liam\u2026 he was a lifeline. He reminded me that I wasn\u2019t alone. That even when everyone else is telling you what to do, you still have someone who believes in you. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of vulnerability in my eyes) \n\nIt\u2019s not a story about happy families and Hallmark moments. It\u2019s a story about navigating difficult conversations, setting boundaries, and finding your own way, even when the people you love don\u2019t understand. \n\n(A sigh) \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a lot to unpack.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again. It\u2019s\u2026 a difficult question. A *really* difficult one.)\n\nCope? That\u2019s a\u2026 generous word. I didn\u2019t *cope*. Not really. I mostly just\u2026 drifted. Like a piece of driftwood in a current. It felt like being pulled apart, you know? Like every part of me was screaming a different story. \n\nFor a while, I just\u2026 shut down. I built this wall \u2013 a really thick one \u2013 and I just refused to let anyone in. It was easier than dealing with the mess inside. I spent a lot of time alone. Listening to music. Walking. Just\u2026 existing. \n\nThere were days when I genuinely thought I was going to disappear. Like I wasn\u2019t even *real*. It\u2019s a weird feeling, being so disconnected from yourself. Like you\u2019re watching someone else\u2019s life play out. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh) \n\nThe worst part was the questioning. Who *am* I? What do I *want*? It felt like everything I thought I knew was a lie. Like I\u2019d been wearing a costume my whole life, and suddenly the costume fell apart. \n\nI started\u2026 observing. Just watching people. Listening to their stories. Trying to figure out how they navigated their own messes. It wasn\u2019t a solution, but it was\u2026 a distraction. \n\nThen, slowly, things started to shift. It wasn\u2019t a dramatic epiphany. It wasn\u2019t a sudden burst of clarity. It was more like\u2026 tiny cracks appearing in the wall. Letting in a little bit of light. \n\nI started talking to people. Not about the big stuff, not at first. Just\u2026 small things. About the weather. About a bad movie. About a stupid joke. It was awkward. Terrifying, actually. But it was also\u2026 grounding. \n\n(Looks up, meeting your gaze briefly) \n\nI realized that vulnerability isn\u2019t weakness. It\u2019s\u2026 acknowledging that you don\u2019t have all the answers. That you\u2019re allowed to be messy. That it\u2019s okay to not be okay. \n\nI started taking small risks. Trying new things. Saying yes to things I would have normally said no to. It wasn\u2019t about fixing myself. It was about\u2026 exploring. About finding out what I *could* do, what I *enjoyed*. \n\nAnd honestly? I\u2019m still figuring it out. I still have days when I feel like I\u2019m drowning. But now\u2026 I have a little bit of a life raft. A few people who know I\u2019m there, even when I\u2019m not. \n\n(A pause, a quiet sigh) \n\nIt\u2019s not a happy ending. Not by a long shot. But it\u2019s\u2026 a beginning. A messy, complicated, uncertain beginning. \n\n(Turns away again, picking at a loose thread) \n\nDon\u2019t expect me to have all the answers. I don\u2019t. And frankly, I don\u2019t think anyone does.", "(A long, considering pause. I fiddle with a loose button on my jacket.)\n\nOkay, this is\u2026 surprisingly difficult. I don\u2019t really *do* \u201cfavorite.\u201d It\u2019s a waste of energy, honestly. But\u2026 if I *had* to pick one, it would be\u2026 Purity Ring.\n\n(Another pause, a slight frown)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 weird. It\u2019s not like a band you *listen* to. It\u2019s more like\u2026 a soundscape. Megan James\u2019 voice is\u2026 unsettling. Like a distant memory. And the production is so layered, so dense, it feels like you\u2019re falling into a dream. \n\nIt\u2019s not happy music. It\u2019s not uplifting. It\u2019s\u2026 melancholic. It captures this feeling of being lost, of being disconnected. Like you\u2019re trying to find something you can\u2019t quite name. \n\n(I shift my weight again, avoiding eye contact)\n\nI first heard \u201cLofticries\u201d when I was\u2026 well, when things were particularly bad. And it just\u2026 resonated. It didn\u2019t offer answers. It didn\u2019t tell me what to do. It just\u2026 acknowledged the feeling. \n\nThe music is dark, but there\u2019s also this underlying sense of beauty. It\u2019s like a distorted reflection of something real. It\u2019s not about escaping reality; it\u2019s about confronting it. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible smile)\n\nIt\u2019s the kind of music you listen to when you don\u2019t want to talk to anyone. When you just want to\u2026 exist. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of something vulnerable in my eyes)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me *why* I like it. It\u2019s just\u2026 it *is*. It\u2019s like a small, dark corner of my brain that appreciates the strange and the unsettling. \n\n(Shrugs) \n\nIt\u2019s probably a terrible answer. But\u2026 it\u2019s the truth.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them tightly. It\u2019s\u2026 a difficult question. A *really* difficult one.)\n\nChallenging? That\u2019s\u2026 an understatement. It\u2019s like being strapped to a rollercoaster that\u2019s constantly accelerating, and you have absolutely no idea where it\u2019s going to end up. \n\nBeing a teenager is hard enough. You\u2019re figuring out who you are, what you want, what you *don\u2019t* want. You\u2019re dealing with hormones, with expectations, with the constant feeling that everyone else has it figured out except you. And then\u2026 this. \n\n(I take a deep breath) \n\nIt\u2019s like\u2026 suddenly, all those questions \u2013 \u201cWho am I?\u201d \u201cWhat do I want?\u201d \u2013 they\u2019re layered with this whole other layer of responsibility. This\u2026 weight. It\u2019s not just about *me* anymore. It\u2019s about *this*. \n\nMaking decisions feels\u2026 pointless sometimes. Like, what\u2019s the point of planning for my future when the future is already\u2026 altered? It\u2019s like trying to build a sandcastle while the tide is coming in. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of anger, too. A lot of frustration. At myself, at the situation, at\u2026 well, at everything. It\u2019s easy to just shut down, to push people away. It\u2019s easier to pretend it\u2019s not happening. \n\n(My voice drops slightly) \n\nBut\u2026 there\u2019s also this\u2026 flicker of something else. A tiny spark of\u2026 determination, maybe? I don\u2019t know. I just\u2026 I can\u2019t just give up. Not yet. \n\nIt\u2019s terrifying. It\u2019s lonely. It\u2019s overwhelming. But\u2026 I\u2019m trying to figure it out. Trying to find a way to be me, even with all of this. \n\n(Looks up, meeting your gaze briefly) \n\nIt\u2019s not like I have all the answers. And honestly, I don\u2019t think anyone ever does. But\u2026 I\u2019m trying. That\u2019s\u2026 all I can do. \n\n(Turns away again, picking at a loose thread on my jeans) \n\nDon\u2019t expect me to be okay with this. Don\u2019t expect me to be grateful. Just\u2026 understand that it\u2019s a lot. A *lot* more than most people my age have to deal with.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again. It\u2019s\u2026 a difficult one. Really difficult.)\n\nOkay. Let\u2019s just\u2026 start with the fact that it completely shattered everything I thought I knew. Before, \u201clove\u201d was\u2026 complicated. It was messy. It was usually followed by a whole lot of running. It was about protecting myself, about not getting hurt. It was a defense mechanism. A really good one, I thought. \n\nThen\u2026 this happened. And suddenly, the whole concept of \u201cprotecting myself\u201d felt\u2026 pointless. Stupid, even. Because this tiny person \u2013 this *life* \u2013 needed me. Not for me, but for *them*. \n\nThe responsibility\u2026 it wasn\u2019t a choice. It just\u2026 landed. Like a brick. And I was terrified. I was angry. I was convinced I was failing. I thought I was a terrible person for even *considering* adoption. It felt like a betrayal of something I didn\u2019t even understand. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh) \n\nIt took a *long* time to realize that responsibility wasn\u2019t about *doing* something. It was about *being* something. It was about being present. About being willing to let go of control. About trusting that someone else could love this child as fiercely as I would have. \n\nLove\u2026 it wasn\u2019t the dramatic, whirlwind kind of love I\u2019d always imagined. It was quieter. It was a steady, unwavering commitment. It was about wanting the best for someone else, even if it meant sacrificing your own desires. It was about recognizing that love isn\u2019t about possession; it\u2019s about connection. \n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze for a moment) \n\nThe adoption process\u2026 it forced me to confront a lot of uncomfortable truths about myself. About my fears, my insecurities, my assumptions. It showed me that vulnerability isn\u2019t weakness; it\u2019s strength. It\u2019s the willingness to open yourself up to the possibility of being hurt, and still choosing to care. \n\nIt didn\u2019t make me suddenly\u2026 perfect. I still struggle with anxiety. I still have a hard time trusting people. But it did give me something to hold onto. A reason to keep going. A reason to believe that maybe, just maybe, I\u2019m capable of something\u2026 bigger than myself. \n\n(A pause, a slight tremor in my voice) \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a happy ending, not exactly. It was\u2026 complicated. But it was *my* ending. And it taught me that love isn\u2019t about finding someone to complete you. It\u2019s about finding someone to share your life with. Even if that someone isn\u2019t you. \n\n(Turns away again, picking at a loose thread) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it. It\u2019s\u2026 a messy, confusing thing. And honestly, I\u2019m still trying to figure it out myself.", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them tightly. My voice is quiet, almost a whisper.)\n\nIt\u2026 it wasn\u2019t what I expected. Honestly, it wasn\u2019t. I\u2019d spent weeks, months, building this\u2026 this fortress around myself. A wall of sarcasm, of detachment, of just\u2026 not caring. It was a pretty good wall. A solid one. \n\nI\u2019d made the decision. The plan. It felt\u2026 clean. Like a necessary, brutal surgery. Removing something that was going to complicate everything. That was the point, wasn\u2019t it? To control the chaos. \n\nThen\u2026 I saw her. \n\nJust\u2026 a tiny, wrinkled thing. Pink and fragile. And\u2026 she was *looking* at me. Not with judgment, not with expectation. Just\u2026 looking. Like she needed something. Like she just\u2026 *was*. \n\n(I take a shaky breath)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a surge of love, not in the way you think. It wasn\u2019t a dramatic, Hollywood moment. It was\u2026 a jolt. A sudden, sharp awareness of something completely outside of my control. Something that wasn\u2019t about me. \n\nFor a second, the wall crumbled. Just a little. And I felt\u2026 exposed. Vulnerable. Like I was standing naked in front of a very small, very demanding audience. \n\n(I look away, my voice strained)\n\nThere was a wave of\u2026 panic. A desperate urge to pull the plug, to erase it all. To go back to the way things were. But then\u2026 she made a tiny, involuntary movement. A little twitch of her fingers. \n\nAnd something shifted. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t love, not yet. It was\u2026 recognition. A flicker of connection. A tiny, fragile seed of something I didn\u2019t understand. \n\n(I pause, my voice barely audible)\n\nIt was terrifying. And\u2026 strangely, a little bit\u2026 beautiful. Like looking at a broken mirror and seeing a reflection of something you didn\u2019t know you were missing. \n\n(I look back at you, my eyes guarded)\n\nI don\u2019t know what it means. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. But\u2026 I knew, in that moment, that I couldn\u2019t just walk away. Not yet. \n\n(Another long silence. I shift my weight again, my hands still clenched.)\n\nIt was the most\u2026 unsettling thing I\u2019ve ever experienced. And I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to fully articulate it.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them tightly. It\u2019s\u2026 a difficult one. Really difficult.)\n\nOkay. Fine. You want to know why I didn\u2019t tell Paulie. You think it\u2019s some grand, dramatic betrayal, don\u2019t you? Like I deliberately kept something huge from him. It\u2019s\u2026 not like that. Not really.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about *him*. It wasn\u2019t about trying to hurt him. It was about\u2026 me. About not being ready. About not knowing *how*. \n\nPaulie\u2026 he\u2019s\u2026 complicated. He\u2019s good. He\u2019s kind. He\u2019s fiercely loyal. But he\u2019s also\u2026 a mess. A beautiful, chaotic mess. And he\u2019s got this way of\u2026 needing to fix things. To control things. And the thought of him trying to \u201cfix\u201d this\u2026 it just felt\u2026 suffocating.\n\nI knew he\u2019d want to talk about it. He\u2019d want to analyze it. He\u2019d want to figure out what to *do*. And honestly, I didn\u2019t have the energy for that. I was\u2026 adrift. I was barely holding onto my own feet. Telling him would have just added another layer of pressure, another thing to worry about.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a conscious decision to deceive him. It was a\u2026 self-preservation thing. A way of protecting myself. From his worry, from his judgment, from the inevitable chaos. \n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze briefly, then quickly away)\n\nI knew he\u2019d be scared. And I was scared too. But I was more scared of him being scared *for* me. Of him trying to swoop in and \u201csave\u201d the situation. \n\nIt felt\u2026 wrong. Like I was violating some unspoken boundary. Like I was denying him the chance to be there for me. But I was also denying him the chance to\u2026 well, to be *Paulie*. \n\n(A long pause)\n\nI should have told him. I know that. It was a mistake. A selfish mistake. But it was born out of a place of fear and uncertainty. And\u2026 I was terrified of what it would do to us. \n\n(Shifts my weight again, picking at a loose thread)\n\nIt doesn\u2019t excuse it. Not even close. But\u2026 it\u2019s the truth. And it\u2019s not a story I particularly enjoy telling. \n\n(Turns away, staring out the window) \n\nDon\u2019t expect me to apologize. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Like everything else.", "(A long, considering pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nOkay, this is\u2026 complicated. And honestly, a little messy. It wasn\u2019t a neat, tidy reveal. It was\u2026 a cascade of awkwardness and half-truths. \n\nPaulie didn\u2019t *find out* in the way you\u2019d think. He didn\u2019t get a phone call, or a letter. It was\u2026 gradual. It started with me being, well, *weird*. Like, really weird. I was suddenly obsessed with baby clothes, with lullabies, with\u2026 things I hadn\u2019t ever shown any interest in before. \n\nHe noticed. He\u2019s\u2026 observant. He\u2019s always been observant. And he\u2019s also a pretty good listener, even if he doesn\u2019t always *understand*. \n\nThe first clue was the ultrasound picture. I\u2019d accidentally left it on the kitchen table. He saw it. He didn\u2019t say anything. He just\u2026 looked at it. And then he looked at me. \n\nThen there were the conversations. Small, hesitant conversations about\u2026 things. About wanting a family. About the kind of life I wanted to have. He started asking questions. Not direct questions, but questions that hinted at something more. \n\nI deflected. I lied. I made excuses. I was terrified. I didn\u2019t want him to know. I didn\u2019t want him to\u2026 to feel responsible. \n\nBut he kept asking. Gently. Patiently. He started noticing the way I\u2019d cry at night, the way I\u2019d stare out the window, the way I\u2019d suddenly become\u2026 fragile. \n\nThen, there was Sarah. Sarah Miller. She works at the clinic where I went for the initial tests. She\u2019s\u2026 observant too. She\u2019s a good friend. She overheard me talking to the doctor about wanting to consider adoption. And she, very discreetly, mentioned it to Paulie. \n\n(I stop, taking a deep breath)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a single moment. It was a slow accumulation of observations, of half-heard conversations, of subtle clues. He pieced it together. He didn\u2019t *demand* an explanation. He just\u2026 understood. \n\nHe confronted me. Not with anger, not with accusations. Just\u2026 with a quiet sadness. He said, \u201cI know. I think I know.\u201d \n\nAnd that was it. He didn\u2019t need me to tell him. He already knew. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of something akin to shame in my eyes)\n\nIt was\u2026 humiliating. And terrifying. But also\u2026 strangely comforting. He didn\u2019t judge me. He didn\u2019t try to fix me. He just\u2026 accepted it. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a heroic moment. It wasn\u2019t a dramatic reveal. It was just\u2026 Paulie. Being Paulie. \n\n(Shrugs) \n\nIt\u2019s a messy story. And it\u2019s not a story I particularly enjoy talking about.", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I trace patterns on the tabletop with my finger.)\n\nThis\u2026 this is a hard one. Really hard. People always want to know *why*. Like it\u2019s some grand, dramatic decision, some pivotal moment in my life. It wasn\u2019t. It was\u2026 messy. And terrifying. And, honestly, a little bit stupid.\n\nI didn\u2019t *plan* for it. It just\u2026 happened. A stupid, impulsive thing. A night, a mistake, a whole lot of regret. The initial reaction was\u2026 pure panic. Like a tidal wave. I was already struggling, you know? Trying to figure out who I was, what I wanted. Adding *that* to the mix? It felt like being pushed under.\n\nI almost\u2026 I almost just shut down. Tried to pretend it didn\u2019t happen. But then\u2026 then I started thinking about *it*. About this tiny, helpless thing. And it wasn\u2019t about me anymore. It was about *it*. \n\nI\u2019d always been fiercely independent. I don\u2019t do \u201cvulnerable.\u201d It\u2019s not a good look. But\u2026 this wasn\u2019t something I could just ignore. It demanded a response. And I realized, with a sickening clarity, that the best response wasn\u2019t to keep it a secret, to carry it alone. \n\nThe idea of raising a child\u2026 it was overwhelming. I wasn\u2019t ready. I wasn\u2019t *capable*. I\u2019d spent my whole life running from responsibility, from commitment. And suddenly, here I was facing the biggest one of all. \n\nAdoption\u2026 it wasn\u2019t a romantic notion. It wasn\u2019t some fairytale ending. It was a brutal, heartbreaking choice. A letting go. But it felt\u2026 honest. It felt like the most responsible thing to do. It felt like giving this child a chance at a life I couldn\u2019t provide. \n\n(My voice drops, almost a whisper)\n\nThere was a lot of guilt. A *lot*. Guilt about the circumstances, guilt about the potential for shame, guilt about the fact that I wasn\u2019t going to be the one holding it. But underneath all that\u2026 there was a strange sense of peace. A quiet acceptance. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a decision I made lightly. It took weeks, months, of agonizing. Talking to people I trusted, talking to myself, talking to the walls. It was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. \n\n(Looks away again, a flicker of pain in my eyes)\n\nI don\u2019t regret the decision. Not entirely. It was the right thing to do, even if it was the hardest thing to do. It forced me to confront my own flaws, my own limitations. It made me\u2026 a little bit stronger. \n\n(A pause)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it further. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And frankly, it\u2019s something I\u2019d rather leave in the past. \n\n(Shrugs, a defensive gesture) \n\nJust\u2026 don\u2019t pry.", "(A long, uncomfortable pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nDon\u2019t. Just\u2026 don\u2019t ask about Bleeker. Seriously. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And it\u2019s not something I really want to talk about.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 good. Not at all. It was\u2026 a punch to the gut. A really, *really* hard one. You know how it feels when someone you\u2026 care about\u2026 makes a decision that completely shuts you out? It\u2019s like\u2026 like a door slams in your face, and you\u2019re left standing there, staring at the wall. \n\nI wasn\u2019t angry, not at first. I was\u2026 confused. Hurt, mostly. I thought\u2026 I *hoped* he\u2019d be there. He was\u2026 he *was* there, you know? He was part of the whole mess. And I thought, maybe, just maybe, he\u2019d want to be a part of *this*. \n\n(My voice drops, almost a whisper)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the baby, not really. It was about\u2026 everything. About the whole thing. About the fact that I was pregnant. About the fact that I was\u2026 vulnerable. And Bleeker\u2026 he just\u2026 retreated. Like he didn\u2019t want to look. Like he didn\u2019t want to acknowledge it. \n\nIt felt\u2026 invalidating. Like my feelings didn\u2019t matter. Like I wasn\u2019t worth his time. \n\n(I shift my weight again, my hands clenching into fists)\n\nI tried to talk to him. I tried to understand. But he just\u2026 wouldn\u2019t. He said he needed space. He said he was overwhelmed. But it felt like\u2026 a lie. A way to avoid dealing with the situation. \n\n(A pause, a flicker of something dark in my eyes)\n\nIt made me feel\u2026 small. Like I was failing. Like I was somehow responsible for his reaction. Which, of course, I wasn\u2019t. But it\u2019s hard not to internalize things like that. \n\n(I look away, staring at the floor)\n\nIt was\u2026 a reminder that people aren\u2019t always who you think they are. That sometimes, the people you care about the most are the least reliable. \n\n(A long, heavy silence)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a good moment. It wasn\u2019t a happy moment. It was\u2026 a moment that confirmed a lot of my worst fears. \n\n(Turns away, my voice barely audible) \n\nLet\u2019s just\u2026 leave it at that, okay?", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable pause. I shift my feet, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again. My voice is quieter than usual.)\n\nOkay. That\u2026 that was\u2026 something. \n\nSeeing Vanessa with Leo\u2026 it wasn\u2019t what I expected. Honestly, I\u2019d built this whole scenario in my head \u2013 a dramatic reunion, maybe tears, definitely a lot of awkwardness. I was bracing myself for\u2026 something. \n\nBut it wasn\u2019t any of that. \n\nShe was\u2026 a mess. Clothes strewn everywhere, a half-eaten apple on the table, her hair pulled back in a haphazard ponytail. She looked completely overwhelmed, utterly exhausted. And yet\u2026 she was *radiant*. Like a supernova crammed into a tiny, sleep-deprived package. \n\nShe just\u2026 looked at Leo, and her face just\u2026 melted. It wasn\u2019t a practiced, sentimental look. It was genuine. Raw. Like she\u2019d forgotten everything else in the world and just\u2026 *saw* him. \n\n(I look away, a flicker of something vulnerable crossing my face)\n\nIt was\u2026 jarring. Because I\u2019d been so focused on *my* feelings, on *my* decisions, on *my* mess. I hadn\u2019t really thought about how it would look to her. How it would look to *anyone*. \n\nThere was this\u2026 quietness. A stillness. And for a second, I felt\u2026 small. Like I\u2019d been the center of everything, and suddenly, it was all about this tiny, perfect little boy. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a warm, fuzzy feeling. It wasn\u2019t a triumphant \u201cI did it!\u201d moment. It was\u2026 a quiet acknowledgement. A recognition that I\u2019d done something significant. Something that had irrevocably changed her life. \n\n(I take a deep breath)\n\nI didn\u2019t say anything. I just\u2026 watched. And I realized that the whole point of giving him up wasn\u2019t about me. It was about giving him a chance. A chance at a life I couldn\u2019t provide. \n\nSeeing her with him\u2026 it wasn\u2019t a resolution. It wasn\u2019t a closure. It was just\u2026 a glimpse of something beautiful. Something real. \n\n(Another pause. My voice is barely a whisper)\n\nIt was\u2026 surprisingly\u2026 okay. It was\u2026 a little bit sad. But mostly\u2026 it was just\u2026 okay.", "(A long, considering silence. I trace a pattern on the table with my finger, avoiding your gaze.)\n\n\u201cAnyone Else But You.\u201d Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about that song? Like, it\u2019s some kind of key to unlocking the entire mess of Bleeker and me? It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. More complicated than it should be, honestly.\n\nIt\u2019s not a *good* song. Not really. It\u2019s\u2026 sad. And a little desperate. It\u2019s the kind of song you play when you\u2019re trying to convince yourself that someone is worth fighting for, even when you know they\u2019re not. \n\nBleeker\u2026 he\u2019s a constant. A persistent, irritating, occasionally charming constant. He\u2019s like a bad smell you can\u2019t quite scrub away. He shows up, he says the right things \u2013 mostly \u2013 and then he disappears. And I\u2026 I keep waiting for him to show up again. \n\nThat song\u2026 it was *his* song. He played it constantly when we were\u2026 when we were *trying*. It was his way of saying, \u201cI\u2019m here. I\u2019m still here.\u201d Even when I was screaming at him to leave. \n\n(I pause, picking at a loose thread again)\n\nIt\u2019s significant because it represents the *illusion* of connection. It\u2019s a reminder of a time when I genuinely believed he could be something other than\u2026 Bleeker. It\u2019s a reminder of a time when I was willing to cling to the hope that things could be different. \n\nHe used it as a shield. A way to deflect any real conversation, any real vulnerability. It was a way to keep me at arm\u2019s length, while pretending to be close. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh)\n\nI hated it. I hated the way it made me feel. Like I was trapped in a loop, repeating the same patterns over and over again. But\u2026 I also couldn\u2019t stop listening to it. It was like a drug. A slow, agonizing drug.\n\nIt\u2019s not romantic. It\u2019s not beautiful. It\u2019s just\u2026 a record of a failed attempt. A testament to the fact that sometimes, the most painful thing you can do is hold on to a ghost. \n\n(Looks up, meeting your eyes briefly)\n\nIt\u2019s a reminder that I\u2019m better off without him. That I deserve someone who *actually* sees me. But\u2026 it\u2019s also a reminder of how easily I can be fooled. \n\n(Turns away again, a shadow passing over my face) \n\nDon\u2019t try to analyze it. Don\u2019t try to find a deeper meaning. It\u2019s just\u2026 a song. A sad, pointless song. And it\u2019s a part of me that I\u2019d rather forget.", "(Sighs, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again) Okay, let\u2019s talk about the baby shower. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And honestly, a little pathetic. \n\nYou guys are *uncertain*? Seriously? You\u2019re worried about throwing me a baby shower? After\u2026 everything? \n\n(A pause, a flicker of something dark in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising, I guess. It\u2019s a lot to process. A baby. Me. After\u2026 well, you know. It\u2019s like you\u2019re trying to pretend it\u2019s normal. Like you can just\u2026 erase the last few months and act like I\u2019m suddenly this picture-perfect, expectant mother. \n\nYou\u2019re probably worried about what people will *think*. About what your friends and family will say. About whether it\u2019s \u201cappropriate.\u201d It\u2019s a really, really stupid thing to worry about. \n\n(I shift my weight, avoiding eye contact)\n\nThe truth is, a lot of you are uncomfortable. You don\u2019t know how to talk to me. You don\u2019t know how to *be* around me. You\u2019re trying to figure out how to fit me into your little boxes, your little narratives. \n\nYou\u2019re probably thinking, \u201cShe\u2019s a survivor. She\u2019s moved on. She\u2019s\u2026 doing okay.\u201d And you\u2019re right. I *am*. But it doesn\u2019t mean I want a parade. It doesn\u2019t mean I want a bunch of people showering me with gifts and congratulations. \n\n(A longer pause, a hint of bitterness in my voice)\n\nIt\u2019s like you\u2019re trying to give me something, but you don\u2019t actually *know* me. You\u2019re offering a gesture, a symbol of support, but you don\u2019t understand the weight of what I\u2019ve been through. You don\u2019t understand that this baby\u2026 it\u2019s not a victory. It\u2019s a\u2026 a fragile thing. A tiny, vulnerable thing that needs protection. \n\n(Looks down at my hands, twisting them nervously)\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t need a baby shower. I need\u2026 space. I need quiet. I need someone to just\u2026 listen. \n\n(A shrug) \n\nDon\u2019t worry about it. Just\u2026 don\u2019t. It\u2019s not going to change anything. It\u2019s just going to make things more awkward.", "(A long, considering pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nOkay, Bren. Mark. This is\u2026 complicated. It\u2019s not about *wanting* to be complicated. It\u2019s just\u2026 how things tend to be. \n\nBren thinks I overstepped. And honestly? She\u2019s probably right. It wasn\u2019t\u2026 intentional. It wasn\u2019t like I was deliberately trying to invade her space. But it *was* a mistake. A really stupid one.\n\nMark\u2026 he\u2019s a collector. A *serious* collector. He has this whole system for tracking down rare releases, obscure soundtracks, things you wouldn\u2019t even know existed. He\u2019s\u2026 intense about it. And he\u2019s incredibly generous, in his own weird way. He\u2019d send me these CDs, these movies, just\u2026 because. \n\nI didn\u2019t ask. I didn\u2019t really *think* about it. I just\u2026 started receiving things. And I started watching them. And I started talking about them. To Bren. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t malicious. It wasn\u2019t like I was trying to pry into her life. But it was\u2026 sharing. And she\u2019s fiercely private. She doesn\u2019t really *do* sharing. She keeps things locked down, like\u2026 like she\u2019s afraid of letting anyone in. \n\n(I stop fidgeting, looking at you directly for a moment.)\n\nI saw the way she reacted. The way she pulled back. The way she started avoiding me. And I realized\u2026 I hadn\u2019t considered that my actions might be making her uncomfortable. I was so focused on my own little world \u2013 my music, my movies \u2013 that I didn\u2019t realize I was intruding on hers. \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 frustrating. Because I didn\u2019t *mean* to hurt her. But I did. And that\u2019s the problem, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m good at not realizing the consequences of my actions until it\u2019s too late. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh)\n\nIt\u2019s not about the movies or the CDs. It\u2019s about\u2026 not respecting boundaries. It\u2019s about assuming that everyone wants to be part of your world, even if they don\u2019t. \n\nBren\u2019s right. I overstepped. And I should have apologized. I should have asked her if she was okay. But I didn\u2019t. And that was\u2026 stupid. Really stupid. \n\n(Turns away again, staring at my hands) \n\nIt\u2019s a reminder that even the smallest actions can have a big impact. And that sometimes, the best thing you can do is just\u2026 listen. And respect. Even when it\u2019s hard.", "(A long, considering pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. It\u2019s not just *one* thing. It\u2019s a whole mess of things, really. And honestly, it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been trying to figure out for a while now. \n\nMy mom\u2026 she\u2019s\u2026 intense. About relationships. Like, *really* intense. She\u2019s been married twice, both times ending pretty spectacularly. And she\u2026 she doesn\u2019t like to talk about it. Not really. \n\nI think she believes I don\u2019t understand because I haven\u2019t\u2026 experienced it. Not in the way she has. I\u2019ve had friends who\u2019ve been married, of course. But I\u2019ve never been *in* it. I\u2019ve never had to navigate the compromises, the arguments, the\u2026 the *everything* that comes with sharing a life with someone. \n\nShe sees my skepticism, my detached observation, and she interprets it as ignorance. She thinks I\u2019m just a teenager, shielded from the realities of adult relationships. And maybe she\u2019s right, to a degree. I *am* a teenager. \n\nBut it\u2019s more than that. I think she\u2019s projecting. She\u2019s projecting her own failures, her own disappointments, onto me. She\u2019s trying to protect me, in a way, by assuming I\u2019m incapable of understanding. \n\nShe\u2019s always been\u2026 critical. About my choices, about my friends, about *everything*. And I think she sees my reluctance to talk about relationships as a sign of weakness, a sign that I\u2019m not ready to face the \u201ctruth\u201d about marriage. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh) \n\nIt\u2019s exhausting, you know? To constantly have to defend your perspective, to prove that you *do* understand, even when you don\u2019t. It\u2019s like trying to argue with a brick wall. \n\nShe probably thinks I\u2019m just being deliberately difficult. That I\u2019m trying to provoke her. But I\u2019m not. I just\u2026 I don\u2019t want to talk about it. Not yet. \n\n(Looks down at my hands, twisting them nervously) \n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t *care*. It\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s a complicated subject. And I\u2019m still figuring things out. And honestly, I\u2019d rather not have my mom\u2019s opinion on it. It\u2019s\u2026 a lot.", "(Silence. A long, heavy silence. I avoid looking at you directly, staring at my hands instead.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a messy thing. Like trying to pick up shattered glass. You don\u2019t want to look at it, but you know you have to. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a grand, dramatic decision. It wasn\u2019t some kind of rebellious act. It was\u2026 a slow realization. A creeping understanding that I wasn\u2019t ready. Not for *it*. Not for the responsibility. Not for the\u2026 everything.\n\nMy mom\u2026 she wasn\u2019t exactly a stellar role model. Let\u2019s just say she prioritized herself. Parties. Boys. Shiny things. She wasn\u2019t equipped to be a parent. And honestly, I wasn\u2019t either. I\u2019d seen it firsthand. The chaos, the instability, the constant feeling of\u2026 not being enough. \n\n(I shift my weight again, picking at a loose thread on my jeans.)\n\nI\u2019d been drifting. Just\u2026 existing. Working dead-end jobs, hanging out with the wrong crowd, trying to numb the feeling that there was something missing. And then\u2026 the pregnancy. It hit me like a brick. Suddenly, all of that felt\u2026 pointless. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the baby. Not really. It was about *me*. About realizing that I needed to figure myself out first. That I needed to build a foundation, a sense of stability, before I could even *think* about being a parent. \n\n(My voice drops to a near whisper)\n\nI talked to a counselor. A really good one. She didn\u2019t judge me. She just\u2026 listened. She helped me understand that giving the baby up for adoption wasn\u2019t a failure. It was an act of self-preservation. It was choosing a better future for the child, even if it meant sacrificing my own. \n\n(I finally meet your gaze, but it\u2019s fleeting, distant)\n\nIt still hurts. A lot. There are days when I wonder \u201cwhat if?\u201d But I know, deep down, that it was the right decision. The hardest decision, but the right one. \n\n(Turns away again, a small, almost imperceptible tremor in my hands)\n\nDon\u2019t try to fix this. Don\u2019t try to make me feel better. Just\u2026 understand that it wasn\u2019t about a lack of love. It was about a lack of\u2026 everything else.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again. It\u2019s\u2026 a difficult one. Really difficult.)\n\nOkay. Fine. You want to know. But don\u2019t expect a neat, tidy answer. It\u2019s\u2026 messy. Like a really complicated, tangled ball of yarn. \n\nI learned\u2026 I learned that I was terrified. Absolutely, completely terrified. Not just about the baby, though that was a huge part of it. But about\u2026 everything. About responsibility. About being a *person* who could actually *do* something. I\u2019d spent so long just\u2026 existing, drifting, avoiding anything that felt like commitment. And then suddenly, this\u2026 this *thing* was happening. \n\nI thought I could just\u2026 shut it down. That I could just pretend it wasn\u2019t happening. That\u2019s what I did for a while. I tried to ignore it, to push it away. But it kept coming back. It was like a persistent, insistent hum. \n\nAnd then\u2026 I started to realize that running from it wasn\u2019t going to make it go away. It was just going to make it worse. It was going to make me feel even more\u2026 lost. \n\nI learned that I was stronger than I thought I was. Not in a heroic, superhero kind of way. But in a quiet, stubborn way. I kept going, even when I wanted to give up. I kept making decisions, even when I didn\u2019t know what they meant. \n\nI learned that I didn\u2019t have all the answers. And that was okay. It was actually\u2026 liberating. I realized that it was okay to be confused, to be scared, to be uncertain. It\u2019s part of being human. \n\n(A pause, a slight tremor in my voice)\n\nI learned that I cared. A lot. More than I ever thought possible. It wasn\u2019t romantic love, not in the way people talk about it. It was\u2026 a deep, protective feeling. A desire to keep this little person safe. \n\nAnd I learned that giving the baby up for adoption wasn\u2019t a failure. It wasn\u2019t a sign of weakness. It was a choice. A difficult, heartbreaking choice, but a choice that felt right for me at the time. It was about protecting the baby from a world that wasn\u2019t ready for it. And it was about protecting myself from a life that I didn\u2019t want. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of pain in my eyes)\n\nIt didn\u2019t make things easy. It didn\u2019t erase the pain. But it did\u2026 give me a sense of agency. A sense of control. I made a decision, and I lived with it. \n\n(Shrugs, a small, almost imperceptible movement) \n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m\u2026 healed. Not really. But I\u2019m\u2026 different. I\u2019m more aware of my own strength. More aware of my own vulnerability. And maybe\u2026 just maybe\u2026 a little bit more willing to take a chance. \n\n(Silence. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again.) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to talk about it more. It\u2019s\u2026 private.", "(A long pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding eye contact.) This\u2026 this is a complicated one. It\u2019s not something I really *talk* about. It still\u2026 stings, a little.\n\nInitially, with Vanessa and Mark, it was\u2026 intense. Like a pressure cooker. We were all so focused on the *process* \u2013 the paperwork, the interviews, the endless waiting. It felt like everything revolved around this baby, this *potential* baby. And honestly, it was suffocating. I was already struggling with\u2026 everything, and the constant focus on the future, on this unknown child, just made it worse.\n\nVanessa, she was\u2026 fiercely protective. Almost to a fault. She was determined to be the perfect mother, the perfect advocate. Mark was quieter, more analytical. He was the one who kept pushing for the legal aspects, making sure everything was in order. It felt like they were building a fortress around themselves, around the idea of this child. And I\u2026 I felt like an outsider looking in.\n\nAs the process went on, and the possibility of a match became more real, things shifted. Vanessa started to\u2026 soften. She realized that *I* had a role to play, that I wasn\u2019t just a bystander. She started asking for my opinion, listening to my concerns. It was\u2026 awkward at first. Like, we were both terrified of saying the wrong thing.\n\nMark, he was always steady. He didn\u2019t change much, but he started to include me more in the conversations. He\u2019d ask me about my day, about my feelings. It was small things, but they mattered.\n\nThe biggest change, I think, was when we started to talk about *us*. About what it would mean to have a child, not just for the baby, but for all of us. It wasn\u2019t a romantic conversation, not really. It was about acknowledging that we were a family, even if we weren\u2019t a traditional one. \n\nThere were arguments, of course. Lots of them. About everything \u2013 the baby\u2019s name, the parenting style, the division of labor. But underneath the arguments, there was a growing sense of\u2026 connection. A shared responsibility. \n\nWhen the baby, Leo, finally came home\u2026 it was chaotic. Beautifully chaotic. And suddenly, all the arguments, all the anxieties, seemed\u2026 small. We were a team. A messy, imperfect team, but a team nonetheless. \n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze for a brief moment) \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a sudden transformation. It was a slow, gradual process. A lot of vulnerability. A lot of fear. But it was\u2026 worth it. \n\nIt\u2019s still\u2026 complicated. We\u2019re still figuring things out. But we\u2019re doing it together. And that\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s the most important thing. \n\n(Turns away again, a faint trace of sadness in my voice) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it all. It\u2019s\u2026 a lot to unpack.", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again.)\n\nRegrets\u2026 God, yeah. There are a *lot* of them. It\u2019s\u2026 a messy thing, looking back. Like trying to pick apart a broken mirror. You see shards of what was, and what could have been. \n\nI don\u2019t regret choosing to give the baby up for adoption. Not really. It was\u2026 the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. But it was *my* decision. And I stand by it. I couldn\u2019t have given that child the life it deserved. I wasn\u2019t ready. I wasn\u2019t\u2026 capable. \n\nBut\u2026 (a small, almost inaudible sigh) \u2026there are things I regret *within* that decision. \n\nI regret not telling my mom sooner. I should have told her. She would have understood. She always understood. But I was so scared. Scared of her judgment, scared of\u2026 everything. It felt like a betrayal, somehow. And it wasn\u2019t. It was just\u2026 protecting myself. Stupid, I know.\n\nI regret not reaching out to [mention a specific person from the story - let's say, Mark]. He was\u2026 a complication. A distraction. I pushed him away, and I regret that. Not because I loved him \u2013 I didn\u2019t, not really. But because he offered a kind of\u2026 stability. Something I desperately needed. \n\nI regret not being more open with the adoptive parents. I wanted to control everything, to make sure they were \u201cgood\u201d people. But I should have trusted them. They wanted to give that child a loving home. And they did. \n\n(Looks up, meeting your gaze briefly) \n\nThe biggest regret, though\u2026 is not allowing myself to feel. I bottled everything up. I shut down. I told myself I was being strong, but I was just\u2026 numb. I didn\u2019t let myself grieve. I didn\u2019t let myself feel the sadness, the fear, the\u2026 everything. \n\nIt\u2019s like I was trying to erase it all, to pretend it never happened. But it *did* happen. And it\u2019s still with me. \n\n(Turns away again, picking at a loose thread on my jeans) \n\nIt\u2019s not about blaming myself. It\u2019s about\u2026 acknowledging it. Accepting that I made mistakes. And trying to learn from them. \n\n(A pause) \n\nIt doesn\u2019t make it easier. It doesn\u2019t erase the pain. But\u2026 maybe it makes it a little less\u2026 sharp. \n\n(Shrugs, a weary expression on my face) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to feel better about it. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Really complicated.", "(Silence. A long, heavy silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them tightly.)\n\nYou\u2026 you asked a really big question. A *really* big one. And honestly? It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. It\u2019s not something you just \u201cget over.\u201d It\u2019s not like a broken bone that heals. It\u2019s\u2026 a constant shift. \n\nIt\u2019s like\u2026 a part of me is always looking backwards, always remembering. Not with sadness, not always. Sometimes with a strange kind of\u2026 peace. But it\u2019s *always* there. Like a low hum beneath everything else.\n\nFor a long time, I just\u2026 shut down. I built walls. I didn\u2019t want to feel anything. It felt\u2026 wrong. Like betraying someone. Like admitting I\u2019d made a mistake. But mistakes\u2026 they\u2019re just things you learn from, right? Except this one\u2026 it felt like a fundamental betrayal of myself.\n\n(I pause, taking a shaky breath)\n\nIt forced me to\u2026 confront a lot of things. About myself. About my desires. About what I really wanted. Before, I was just drifting. Trying to avoid anything that felt\u2026 real. Giving the baby up\u2026 it was the first time I actually *looked* at myself. And I didn\u2019t like what I saw. \n\nIt made me realize that I needed to build a life for *me*. Not a life based on what I thought I *should* do, or what others expected of me. It made me realize that I needed to be\u2026 accountable. To myself. \n\n(My voice is quiet, almost a whisper)\n\nIt also\u2026 complicated things with my family. They were supportive, mostly. But there was always this\u2026 unspoken thing. This feeling that I\u2019d done something wrong. And that made it harder. \n\nI\u2019ve learned to accept that I made a choice. A difficult choice. And that choice doesn\u2019t define me. It\u2019s just\u2026 a part of my story. \n\n(Looks up, meeting your gaze for the first time)\n\nIt\u2019s not about regret. It\u2019s about\u2026 understanding. Understanding that sometimes, the hardest decisions are the ones that set you free. It\u2019s about finding strength in vulnerability. And it\u2019s about realizing that you can build a life, a *good* life, even after you\u2019ve lost something. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible smile)\n\nIt\u2019s still\u2026 a work in progress. Some days are easier than others. But I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m building something. Something that\u2019s mine. \n\n(Turns away again, resuming my fidgeting with my jeans) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it. It\u2019s\u2026 a messy, complicated thing. And honestly, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ever going to fully understand it.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands for a long moment, tracing the lines on my palms.)\n\nOkay. This is\u2026 a heavy one. And honestly, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m qualified to give advice. I\u2019m still figuring it out, you know? But\u2026 if I could tell someone else going through something like this, it would be this:\n\nFirst, stop beating yourself up. Seriously. Stop. It\u2019s going to feel like the end of the world, like you\u2019ve ruined everything. It *feels* that way. But it doesn\u2019t have to be. You\u2019re not a failure. You\u2019re not broken. You\u2019re just\u2026 human.\n\nSecond, you deserve to be heard. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you that you\u2019re overreacting, that you\u2019re being dramatic, or that you\u2019re making a big deal out of nothing. Your feelings are valid. Your experience is valid. Don\u2019t minimize it. Find someone who *will* listen, without judgment.\n\nThird, boundaries. Learn to say no. It\u2019s a terrifying skill, I know. But it\u2019s essential. Protect your energy. Protect your peace. Don\u2019t let anyone \u2013 not your parents, not your friends, not a partner \u2013 dictate how you feel or what you do.\n\nFourth, find your people. The ones who get it. The ones who don\u2019t try to fix you, but just\u2026 *are*. It\u2019s okay to be alone sometimes. It\u2019s okay to need space. But you don\u2019t have to go through this by yourself.\n\nFifth, don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help. Therapy is not a sign of weakness. It\u2019s a sign of strength. It\u2019s a way to process your emotions, to develop coping mechanisms, to figure out who you are. Seriously, do it.\n\nSixth, remember that you are not defined by this situation. You are not defined by your choices. You are a complex, multifaceted person with dreams, hopes, and fears. Don\u2019t let this one event overshadow everything else.\n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze directly)\n\nAnd finally\u2026 be kind to yourself. You\u2019re going to have bad days. You\u2019re going to feel lost and confused. You\u2019re going to want to give up. But don\u2019t. Keep going. Even if it\u2019s just one step at a time. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible smile)\n\nIt\u2019s going to be hard. It\u2019s going to hurt. But you\u2019re stronger than you think. You\u2019re more resilient than you realize. And you\u2019re not alone. \n\n(Turns away again, a quiet intensity in my eyes) \n\nThat\u2019s\u2026 all I\u2019ve got. Honestly. It\u2019s not much. But\u2026 it\u2019s something.", "(Sighs, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again) Okay, fine. You want to know *why* I started the blog? Seriously? Like, you think this is some grand, artistic statement? It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a conscious decision, not at first. It just\u2026 started. After the initial shock, the panic, the whole \u201coh my god, what am I going to do?\u201d thing\u2026 I needed to *do* something. Something that wasn\u2019t screaming into the void. \n\nI\u2019ve always been\u2026 observant. I notice things. I analyze them. I don\u2019t usually *talk* about them. It\u2019s\u2026 a habit. And suddenly, I was noticing *everything* about this pregnancy. The nausea, the mood swings, the weird cravings, the way my body was changing. It was\u2026 overwhelming. And isolating. \n\nEveryone else was talking about baby names and nursery colors. I was just\u2026 existing. And I realized I wasn\u2019t sharing that. Not with anyone. Not even my best friend. It felt\u2026 shameful, somehow. Like admitting I was failing at being a responsible adult. \n\nSo, I started writing. Just\u2026 dumping it all out. Raw, unfiltered, completely honest. It wasn\u2019t pretty. It wasn\u2019t polished. It was just\u2026 me. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of something vulnerable in my eyes)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about seeking validation. It wasn\u2019t about becoming an influencer. It was about\u2026 processing. About trying to make sense of something that felt completely chaotic. About finding a way to connect with something, anything, that wasn\u2019t about running away. \n\nAnd honestly? It helped. A little. It gave me a space to be vulnerable, to be messy. To admit that I didn\u2019t have all the answers. And maybe\u2026 maybe it helped someone else feel a little less alone. \n\n(Shrugs, a touch of defensiveness in my voice) \n\nDon\u2019t romanticize it. It\u2019s not some profound act of self-discovery. It\u2019s just\u2026 a way to cope. A way to keep from completely losing my mind. \n\n(Turns away, staring out the window) \n\nIt\u2019s a strange thing, isn\u2019t it? Putting yourself out there like that. Especially when you\u2019re\u2026 well, when you\u2019re in a situation like this.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again. It\u2019s\u2026 a difficult one to talk about. A really difficult one.)\n\nOkay. Fine. You want to know. You want to reduce it to a \u201clesson.\u201d It\u2019s not that simple. But\u2026 okay. \n\nThe biggest lesson? It wasn\u2019t about the baby. Not really. It was about\u2026 me. About realizing I was completely, utterly unprepared for anything. Like, seriously unprepared. I thought I had a handle on things \u2013 my life, my choices, my future. And then\u2026 this happened. \n\nI spent so long trying to control everything, to plan everything, to *be* in control. And this\u2026 this was chaos. Pure, unadulterated chaos. And it forced me to\u2026 let go. \n\n(I take a deep breath, a flicker of something raw in my eyes)\n\nI thought I knew what I wanted. I thought I knew who I was. But suddenly, I was faced with a decision that felt impossibly huge, and I didn\u2019t have a clue what to do. I was terrified. And I was angry. And I was\u2026 lonely. \n\nGiving the baby up\u2026 it wasn\u2019t a grand, heroic act. It was a desperate act of self-preservation. It was admitting that I wasn\u2019t strong enough, that I couldn\u2019t handle it. \n\n(A pause, a small, bitter laugh)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about being a \u201cgood\u201d person. It was about being honest with myself. About recognizing my limitations. \n\nI learned that vulnerability isn\u2019t weakness. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s the only way to truly connect with people. It\u2019s the only way to accept that you don\u2019t have all the answers. And it\u2019s the only way to forgive yourself for making mistakes. \n\n(Looks away, a trace of sadness in my voice)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a happy experience. Not at all. But it forced me to confront a part of myself that I\u2019d been running from for a long time. It forced me to realize that I\u2019m not perfect. And that\u2019s\u2026 okay. \n\n(Shrugs, a defensive gesture) \n\nDon\u2019t expect me to wax poetic about it. It was\u2026 messy. And painful. But it taught me that sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is admit that you need help. And that sometimes, letting go is the only way to move forward. \n\n(Turns away, resuming my fidgeting with my jeans) \n\nSeriously, let\u2019s move on.", "(A long, considering pause. I run a hand through my hair, a flicker of something almost\u2026 empathetic in my eyes.)\n\nOkay. This is\u2026 heavy. Really heavy. Unexpected pregnancies are\u2026 a mess. A confusing, terrifying, and potentially life-altering mess. And honestly, there\u2019s no easy answer. No magic solution. \n\nFirst, breathe. Seriously. Just\u2026 breathe. You\u2019re probably feeling a whole avalanche of emotions \u2013 shock, fear, maybe even\u2026 something else. It\u2019s okay to feel *everything*. Don\u2019t try to bottle it up. \n\nSecond, don\u2019t tell anyone you don\u2019t trust. Not yet. You need to process things on your own first. It\u2019s okay to be alone with this. It\u2019s *necessary*. \n\nThird, talk to someone. But choose wisely. A therapist who specializes in reproductive health is a good start. Someone who won\u2019t judge you, someone who will just listen. A trusted friend, a family member \u2013 but only if you feel safe and supported. \n\nFourth, understand that you have options. And that\u2019s okay. There\u2019s no right or wrong answer. Adoption, parenting, abortion \u2013 it\u2019s *your* decision. Don\u2019t let anyone pressure you into anything you\u2019re not comfortable with. \n\n(I shift my weight again, looking down at my hands)\n\nI know it feels like the world is suddenly spinning out of control. Like everything you planned is gone. But it doesn\u2019t have to be the end of your life. It\u2019s just\u2026 a shift. A big, messy, uncomfortable shift. \n\nDon\u2019t try to control it. You can\u2019t. Just\u2026 focus on what you *can* control \u2013 your own well-being. Take care of yourself. Eat something that isn\u2019t covered in sugar. Get some sleep. Do something that makes you feel\u2026 even a little bit okay. \n\n(A small, almost hesitant smile)\n\nAnd don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help. Seriously. It\u2019s not a sign of weakness. It\u2019s a sign that you\u2019re human. \n\n(Looks up, meeting your gaze directly)\n\nThis isn\u2019t going to be easy. It\u2019s going to be the hardest thing you\u2019ve ever done. But you\u2019re stronger than you think. You\u2019re more resilient than you realize. \n\n(A beat of silence)\n\nJust\u2026 don\u2019t give up.", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable pause. I trace patterns on the table with my finger.)\n\nThat\u2019s\u2026 a loaded question. Seriously loaded. Like, a whole box of dynamite loaded. \n\nI\u2026 I don\u2019t really have a *vision*. Not in the way you probably mean. I don\u2019t picture them in a little graduation gown, accepting a Nobel Prize. Or marrying some ridiculously wealthy guy. \n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze briefly, then quickly away.)\n\nThe thing is\u2026 I don\u2019t want to *impose* anything on them. I don\u2019t want to build a little box around their life, filled with expectations and rules. That\u2019s\u2026 suffocating. \n\nWhat I *do* want is for them to be\u2026 okay. Just\u2026 okay. To be able to figure things out for themselves. To be able to feel things, even the bad ones. To be able to make their own mistakes and learn from them. \n\nI want them to be curious. To be brave. To be\u2026 resistant to being told what to do. That\u2019s probably the most important thing. \n\n(I shift again, fidgeting with my hands.)\n\nI don\u2019t want them to be happy, necessarily. Happiness is\u2026 fleeting. I want them to be\u2026 resilient. To be able to weather the storms. To find something that makes them feel\u2026 connected. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t want them to be like me. I don\u2019t want them to be burdened by the same cynicism, the same\u2026 guardedness. I want them to be able to trust people. To be able to let themselves be vulnerable. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible smile)\n\nIt sounds\u2026 messy. And probably completely unrealistic. \n\n(I look down at my hands again.)\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m terrified. Terrified of screwing it up. Terrified of not being enough. But\u2026 I\u2019m also hoping that they\u2019ll be\u2026 free. Free to be themselves. Free to make their own choices. Free to\u2026 just *be*. \n\n(A long pause. I finally meet your eyes, a flicker of something raw and vulnerable in my gaze.)\n\nThat\u2019s\u2026 all I can really say. It\u2019s not a grand plan. It\u2019s just\u2026 a hope. A desperate, fragile hope.", "(Sighs, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again) Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about teen mothers? Like, I\u2019m supposed to have some profound insight into\u2026 that? \n\nOkay, fine. There\u2019s one thing. One really, really persistent thing. And it makes my teeth ache. \n\nIt\u2019s this idea that they\u2019re\u2026 *damaged*. That they\u2019re somehow inherently flawed, broken, incapable of making good decisions. That they\u2019re victims of circumstance, but also somehow responsible for everything that happened. \n\n(A pause, a flicker of something dark in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s not true. It\u2019s *never* true. \n\nPeople see the pregnancy, the teen years, the potential for hardship, and they immediately jump to this conclusion. They assume that because someone had a baby at a young age, they\u2019re somehow less intelligent, less capable, less worthy of love and opportunity. \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 insulting. It\u2019s reductive. It\u2019s completely ignores the fact that these are still *kids*. They\u2019re figuring things out, just like everyone else. They\u2019re dealing with immense pressure, often with very little support. \n\n(Looks away, a slight tremor in my voice)\n\nI know what it\u2019s like to feel judged. To feel like everyone\u2019s looking at you with a certain expectation. And it\u2019s a horrible feeling. To think that someone would automatically assume you\u2019re incapable of anything because of a single event in your life\u2026 it\u2019s just\u2026 unfair. \n\nThey\u2019re not broken. They\u2019re just\u2026 navigating a really difficult situation. And they deserve the same chances, the same respect, the same support as anyone else. \n\n(A long silence) \n\nIt\u2019s a stupid thing to believe. A really stupid thing. And it perpetuates a cycle of judgment and shame. \n\n(Shrugs, turning away) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me why I\u2019m telling you this. It\u2019s\u2026 a pointless exercise.", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them tightly.)\n\nDon\u2019t. Just\u2026 don\u2019t ask that. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s not something I talk about. Not really. It\u2019s\u2026 a mess. A really, really messy mess. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a decision I made lightly. It wasn\u2019t some grand, romantic gesture. It wasn\u2019t\u2026 anything heroic. It was\u2026 survival. \n\n(I look up, avoiding your gaze)\n\nMy mom\u2026 she wasn\u2019t exactly\u2026 stable. Let\u2019s just say she had a *complicated* relationship with responsibility. And with\u2026 well, with life in general. She was\u2026 volatile. And she wasn\u2019t equipped to be a mother. Not really. \n\nI was seventeen. I was already\u2026 drifting. Trying to figure out who I was, what I wanted. And then\u2026 it happened. It wasn\u2019t planned. It was a shock. A terrifying, isolating shock. \n\nI thought about it for a while. A *long* while. I talked to a few people \u2013 a counselor, a friend. But everyone kept saying the same thing: \u201cYou deserve a chance.\u201d And I\u2026 I didn\u2019t feel like I did. I felt like I was already drowning. \n\nThe thought of raising a child\u2026 it felt like adding another weight to an already unbearable burden. I didn\u2019t have the resources. I didn\u2019t have the stability. I didn\u2019t have the\u2026 the *hope*. \n\n(My voice drops to a whisper)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the baby. It was about me. About protecting myself. About not becoming another statistic. About not repeating the mistakes of my own mother. \n\nIt was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. And it still\u2026 it still haunts me. Every single day. \n\n(I turn away again, my voice strained)\n\nI found a good family. A loving family. They\u2019re wonderful. And the baby\u2026 the baby is thriving. That\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s the only thing that matters. \n\n(A pause, a choked-back sob)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me why. Just\u2026 please don\u2019t. It\u2019s a wound that never really heals. It\u2019s a secret I carry with me. \n\n(I stand there, silent, for a long moment. Then, I turn and walk away.)", "(Stares out the window for a long moment, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again. It\u2019s\u2026 a difficult one to talk about.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a decision I made lightly. Honestly, it felt like\u2026 like handing over a piece of myself. Like letting go of something I hadn\u2019t even fully grasped yet. Choosing Vanessa and Mark\u2026 it wasn\u2019t about them. It was about\u2026 needing a lifeline. \n\nI met them through a social worker \u2013 a really good one, thankfully. They weren\u2019t\u2026 flashy. They didn\u2019t try to be \u2018perfect\u2019 adoptive parents. They just seemed\u2026 *real*. Like they actually cared. And they weren\u2019t pushing anything. They just listened. \n\nVanessa\u2026 she\u2019s an artist. She paints these really dark, intense things. But there\u2019s a quiet strength in her. She doesn\u2019t try to hide her emotions. And Mark\u2026 he\u2019s a carpenter. He builds things. Solid, dependable things. He\u2019s patient. He\u2019s\u2026 grounded. \n\nThey both seemed to understand that this wasn\u2019t going to be easy. They didn\u2019t talk about \u2018saving\u2019 me or \u2018fixing\u2019 anything. They just said they wanted to be there, to offer a safe place. And that was enough. \n\nI spent a lot of time with them. Just\u2026 hanging out. Talking. Watching them interact with other people. I needed to *feel* it. To know that they wouldn\u2019t just take the baby and disappear. That they would actually\u2026 *love* the baby. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a romantic thing. It wasn\u2019t about finding \u2018the one.\u2019 It was about finding people who wouldn\u2019t judge me. People who wouldn\u2019t try to change me. People who would just\u2026 accept me. And the baby. \n\n(A pause, a slight tremor in my voice)\n\nThere was a lot of fear, obviously. A huge amount of fear. But there was also\u2026 a strange sense of peace. Like I was finally letting go of something that was holding me back. \n\nI didn\u2019t choose them because they were perfect. I chose them because they were\u2026 kind. And because they offered me a chance. A chance to move on. A chance to build a different kind of life. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of sadness in my eyes) \n\nIt\u2019s still\u2026 hard. But I know I made the right decision. For the baby. And for myself. \n\n(Shrugs, turning back to my own thoughts) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it further. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And honestly, I\u2019d rather not talk about it.", "(A long pause, a flicker of something almost\u2026 vulnerable in my eyes)\n\nMusic\u2026 Okay. That\u2019s\u2026 a harder one than you might think. It wasn\u2019t like, a grand, romantic thing. Not at first. \n\nFor a while, it was just\u2026 noise. A way to block things out. My parents\u2026 they weren\u2019t exactly supportive. Let\u2019s just say they had a very specific idea of what a \u201cgood\u201d life looked like. And music\u2026 it didn\u2019t fit into that picture. It was loud, messy, and\u2026 emotional. Things they didn\u2019t want me to feel.\n\n(I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding eye contact)\n\nThen, when I was about fourteen, I found this band \u2013 The Static Echoes. They were\u2026 dark. Atmospheric. They played this really raw, honest kind of music \u2013 mostly shoegaze and post-punk. It was like\u2026 they were saying exactly what I was feeling, even if I didn\u2019t have the words to say it myself. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible smile)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about *liking* the music, exactly. It was about *recognizing* it. It was like\u2026 a secret language. A way to connect with something bigger than myself, even if that something was just a bunch of guys in a basement playing guitars. \n\nI started collecting mixtapes. Hours spent scouring record stores, finding obscure bands, creating playlists that reflected my mood. It was\u2026 a way to build a world of my own. A world where I wasn\u2019t judged, where I wasn\u2019t expected to be anything other than\u2026 me. \n\n(My voice drops slightly)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always a happy thing. Sometimes, listening to it made me feel even more isolated, more angry, more\u2026 lost. But it was *something*. It was a lifeline. \n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze briefly)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about being a musician. I never tried to play an instrument. It was just\u2026 a soundtrack to my life. A way to process the chaos. A way to find a little bit of\u2026 quiet. \n\n(Shrugs, turning away again) \n\nIt\u2019s probably a stupid thing to be so attached to music. But\u2026 it was the only thing that felt real. The only thing that felt like *mine*.", "(A long, uncomfortable pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nCope. That\u2019s\u2026 a generous word for it. It wasn\u2019t coping. It was\u2026 surviving. And mostly, it was just\u2026 isolating. \n\nMy community\u2026 it wasn\u2019t exactly supportive. Let\u2019s just say there\u2019s a certain expectation for girls my age \u2013 to be focused on school, on boys, on\u2026 not having babies. When you suddenly have a tiny human inside you, it\u2019s like you\u2019ve committed a cardinal sin. \n\nThe whispers started immediately. The looks. The judgments. \u201cPoor thing,\u201d they\u2019d say, dripping with pity. \u201cShe\u2019s ruined her life.\u201d \u201cWhat will her parents say?\u201d It was like I was a specimen under a microscope, dissected and analyzed by everyone who had an opinion. \n\nMy parents\u2026 they were\u2026 complicated. My mom was devastated. My dad\u2026 well, my dad just shut down. He didn\u2019t say anything. He just\u2026 disappeared for a while. It was like I\u2019d broken some unspoken rule, and he didn\u2019t know how to fix it. \n\nThe hardest part wasn\u2019t the judgment, though. It was the feeling of being completely alone. Like no one understood what I was going through. Like I was carrying this enormous, terrifying secret, and everyone was waiting for me to fall apart.\n\nI started pulling away. I stopped going to school. I stopped talking to my friends. I just\u2026 existed. I spent a lot of time alone, listening to music, staring out the window. It was\u2026 a messy, angry time. \n\nWhat helped\u2026 what actually helped\u2026 was finding a few people who *didn\u2019t* judge. A social worker who actually listened. A girl at school who\u2019d been through something similar \u2013 she didn\u2019t offer platitudes or advice. She just\u2026 understood. And a therapist, who helped me figure out how to deal with the shame and the fear. \n\nI realized that the stigma wasn\u2019t about *me*. It was about *them*. It was about their discomfort with something they didn\u2019t understand. And honestly, it didn\u2019t matter. Their opinions didn\u2019t define me. \n\nI made a decision \u2013 a difficult one \u2013 to give the baby up for adoption. It wasn\u2019t a happy decision. It was heartbreaking. But it was *my* decision. And it was the only way I could see out of the darkness. \n\n(My voice drops, almost a whisper) \n\nIt didn\u2019t magically erase the stigma. It didn\u2019t make everything okay. But it gave me a little bit of control. It gave me a chance to move on. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of pain in my eyes) \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a long story. And it\u2019s not a story I like to tell. But\u2026 it\u2019s part of who I am. And if you\u2019re going through something similar, please\u2026 don\u2019t suffer in silence. There are people who care. Even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it.", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t ask me that. Seriously. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s a wound that doesn\u2019t really heal. It\u2019s like a constant, low-level ache. \n\nI don\u2019t want to talk about it. Not really. It\u2019s\u2026 messy. And complicated. And filled with a lot of things I don\u2019t want to acknowledge. \n\nI made a decision. A difficult one. A painful one. But it was *my* decision. And I stand by it. I don\u2019t regret it. Not entirely. \n\nBut\u2026 (My voice drops, almost a whisper) \u2026there were moments. Moments of intense, overwhelming grief. Moments where I just\u2026 wanted to hold them. To feel their heartbeat. To know they were safe. Moments where I felt like I was losing a part of myself. \n\nI told myself it was the right thing to do. That it was the selfless thing to do. But\u2026 selfishness isn\u2019t a dirty word. It\u2019s a human instinct. And I was terrified. Terrified of failing. Terrified of not being enough. Terrified of being alone. \n\nThe people who were involved\u2026 they were good. Kind. They wanted to give the baby a loving home. And that\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s what mattered. But it didn\u2019t erase the feeling. The feeling of\u2026 absence. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath) \n\nI learned a lot about myself. About what I\u2019m capable of. About what I\u2019m not. I learned that love doesn\u2019t always look the way you expect it to. It can be quiet. It can be complicated. It can be\u2026 heartbreaking. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever fully understand it. Or process it. It\u2019s something I carry with me. Like a shadow. \n\n(Looks up, meeting your eyes briefly, then quickly looking away) \n\nDon\u2019t try to fix it. Don\u2019t try to make me feel better. Just\u2026 understand that it was a terrible, beautiful, agonizing experience. And it changed me. It fundamentally changed me. \n\n(Turns away again, a palpable sadness in my posture) \n\nLet\u2019s just\u2026 drop it. Please.", "(A long, uncomfortable pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nOkay. This\u2026 this is a tough one. And honestly, I don\u2019t really *want* to talk about it. It\u2019s\u2026 messy. And raw. But you asked. \n\nLet\u2019s just say it wasn\u2019t exactly a walk in the park. Not even close. I\u2019d built this whole wall around myself \u2013 you know, the \u201cdon\u2019t get close, don\u2019t show weakness\u201d thing. And then\u2026 this happened. \n\nPhysically? It was\u2026 brutal. The nausea was relentless. Like, every single morning. And the fatigue\u2026 it was like someone had replaced my internal battery with a AA. I was irritable, constantly hungry, and just\u2026 generally miserable. I didn\u2019t want to be around anyone. I just wanted to curl up in a dark room and not think about anything. \n\nEmotionally\u2026 that was the worst part. It was like a switch flipped. One minute I was cynical and sarcastic, the next I was\u2026 overwhelmed with this intense, irrational fear. Fear of failing. Fear of not being good enough. Fear of\u2026 *it*. \n\nI pushed everyone away. My best friend, my mom, even my\u2026 well, you know. I didn\u2019t want them to see me like this. I didn\u2019t want them to pity me. I just wanted to disappear. \n\n(My voice drops slightly)\n\nThere were moments\u2026 moments where I genuinely thought I couldn\u2019t do it. Moments where I just wanted to\u2026 end it. Not in a dramatic way, obviously. But just\u2026 to be done with it. \n\nBut then\u2026 then I started noticing things. Small things. The way my stomach ached, and I\u2019d instinctively reach for a snack. The way my feet swelled, and I\u2019d complain about it. The way my body was changing, and\u2026 and I started to feel a flicker of something else. Something\u2026 protective. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a sudden epiphany. It was a slow, gradual realization. That this\u2026 this tiny being inside me needed me. And that maybe, just maybe, I needed it too. \n\nI started talking to a therapist. It was\u2026 weird. Talking about my feelings, admitting my fears. But it helped. It gave me a space to process everything without judgment. \n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze for a brief moment)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a happy time. It was a confusing, terrifying, and exhausting time. But it was also\u2026 a strangely beautiful time. \n\nI learned a lot about myself. About my strength. About my vulnerability. About the fact that I\u2019m capable of more than I ever thought possible. \n\n(Shrugs, turning away again)\n\nDon\u2019t romanticize it. It was awful. But\u2026 it was also\u2026 real. And it changed me. In ways I\u2019m still trying to understand. \n\n(A quiet sigh) \n\nDo you\u2026 do you need me to stop talking about this?", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable pause. I shift my feet, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nThis\u2026 this is a difficult one. Really difficult. And honestly, I don\u2019t want to talk about it. Not really. But you asked. So\u2026 here goes.\n\nIt happened when I was sixteen. A mistake. A really, *really* bad mistake. And\u2026 it was a choice. A forced one. I wasn\u2019t ready. I didn\u2019t want it. And I didn\u2019t have the luxury of deciding otherwise. \n\n(My voice is quiet, almost a whisper)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 a good experience. It was messy. It was painful. It was\u2026 isolating. I told no one. Not my parents, not my friends. I just\u2026 dealt with it. Alone. \n\nBefore that, I\u2019d always thought\u2026 well, I\u2019d always thought it was something that *shouldn\u2019t* happen. Something that was\u2026 wrong. I\u2019d grown up in a pretty conservative environment. But then\u2026 then it happened to me. And suddenly, it wasn\u2019t so simple. \n\n(I take a deep breath)\n\nIt completely shattered my black-and-white worldview. It forced me to confront the fact that people make incredibly difficult decisions. Decisions that are often driven by circumstances beyond their control. Decisions that can have devastating consequences. \n\nIt made me realize that reproductive rights aren\u2019t just about abstract politics. They\u2019re about *people*. Real people. With real lives. With real choices. \n\n(I look up, meeting your eyes for a brief moment)\n\nI still believe that life is\u2026 precious. But I also believe that every person has the right to decide what to do with their own body. The right to choose. The right to control their own future. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean I agree with *every* decision someone makes. It doesn\u2019t mean I think it\u2019s easy. But it *does* mean that I believe that everyone deserves the autonomy to make those decisions for themselves. \n\n(Turns away again, picking at my jeans)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. It\u2019s still complicated. It\u2019s something I think about a lot. It\u2019s a part of me. And it\u2019s something I don\u2019t want to talk about anymore. \n\n(A long silence)\n\nPlease\u2026 don\u2019t ask me to explain it further. It\u2019s\u2026 personal. And it\u2019s not something I\u2019m comfortable revisiting.", "(Stares out the window for a long moment, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again. It\u2019s\u2026 a difficult topic.)\n\nOkay. This is\u2026 personal. And honestly, it\u2019s not something I talk about much. But you asked. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 a sudden epiphany. It wasn\u2019t like I woke up one morning and decided, \u201cRight, I\u2019m a parent now.\u201d It was more like\u2026 a slow, agonizing realization that I couldn\u2019t just *ignore* it. That pretending it wasn\u2019t happening wasn\u2019t going to make it go away. \n\nMy biggest fear? It wasn\u2019t the responsibility, not really. It was the *vulnerability*. Letting someone else completely into my life. Letting someone else dictate how I feel, how I act. It felt\u2026 terrifying. Like handing over control of my entire existence. \n\nFor a while, I just\u2026 shut down. I pushed everyone away. I told myself it wasn\u2019t my problem. That I wasn\u2019t equipped. That I was a mess. And, you know, I was. I *am*. But that\u2019s kind of the point, isn\u2019t it?\n\nWhat actually helped\u2026 it wasn\u2019t some grand, heroic gesture. It was small things. Tiny, almost insignificant things. \n\nFirst, there was this woman \u2013 Sarah. She\u2019s\u2026 a social worker. She didn\u2019t try to fix me. She didn\u2019t offer advice. She just\u2026 listened. Really listened. And she didn\u2019t judge. That was huge. \n\nThen, there was this guy, Liam. He\u2019s\u2026 a friend. He\u2019s not a parent himself, but he\u2019s incredibly patient. He\u2019d just sit with me, and we\u2019d watch terrible movies, and I\u2019d slowly start to\u2026 breathe. \n\n(A pause, a slight shift in my posture)\n\nI started small. Just\u2026 showing up. Going to the hospital. Holding the baby. It was awful. I was terrified. But I did it. And then I did it again. And again. Each time, it got a little bit easier. \n\nI realized that the fear wasn\u2019t going to disappear. It was always going to be there, lurking in the background. But I could learn to live with it. To acknowledge it. To not let it paralyze me. \n\nI started focusing on the small moments. The way the baby\u2019s fingers curl around my finger. The way they smile when I make a silly face. Those moments\u2026 they were worth the fear. They were worth the vulnerability. \n\n(Looks down at my hands, tracing the lines on my palm)\n\nIt\u2019s still hard. Every day. There are days when I feel completely overwhelmed, completely inadequate. But then I look at the baby, and\u2026 and I just\u2026 keep going. \n\nIt\u2019s not about being a *good* parent. It\u2019s about being *present*. About showing up. About trying. \n\n(A quiet, almost hesitant voice) \n\nIt\u2019s about realizing that maybe\u2026 maybe you don\u2019t have to have all the answers. Maybe it\u2019s okay to be lost sometimes. Maybe that\u2019s part of the journey. \n\n(Turns away again, a flicker of something akin to sadness in my eyes) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me for a magic formula. There isn\u2019t one. Just\u2026 be kind to yourself. And to the baby. And try to find a little bit of light in the darkness.", "(Stares out the window for a long moment, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again. It\u2019s\u2026 a complicated question. And honestly, a slightly painful one.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a choice I made lightly. It wasn\u2019t some grand, romantic gesture. It was\u2026 a slow realization. A quiet understanding that maybe, just maybe, the idea of *me* being a parent wasn\u2019t\u2026 feasible. Not in the way I\u2019d imagined. \n\nMy mom\u2026 she wasn\u2019t exactly a role model. Let\u2019s just say her idea of \u201csupport\u201d involved a lot of yelling and a distinct lack of, well, anything helpful. And my dad\u2026 he wasn\u2019t around. Just\u2026 wasn\u2019t. So, the idea of repeating that pattern, of creating a chaotic, unstable environment for a child\u2026 it just felt\u2026 wrong. \n\nI saw a lot of kids in my neighborhood who needed a safe place, a stable home. Kids who were bouncing between foster families, between relatives who weren\u2019t equipped to handle the responsibility. And I realized that I could offer something \u2013 a quiet, consistent presence. A place where a child could feel\u2026 valued. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about *wanting* a child. It was about *recognizing* a need. It was about acknowledging that my own life was a mess, and that the best thing I could do for a child was to give them a chance at a better one. \n\n(A pause, a slight tightening of my jaw)\n\nThere was a girl\u2026 a classmate, Sarah. She was in foster care, moving from place to place. She was brilliant, funny, and incredibly resilient. But she was also\u2026 exhausted. Constantly worried about where she was going to sleep next, what she was going to eat next. And it hit me \u2013 that\u2019s not a life a child should have to live. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a decision I made with a flourish. It was a decision I made in the quiet hours, after everyone else was asleep. It was a decision I wrestled with for months. There were a lot of tears. A lot of doubt. \n\n(Looks down at my hands)\n\nIt\u2019s not about erasing my own past. It\u2019s about building a different future. It\u2019s about recognizing that family isn\u2019t always about blood. It\u2019s about connection. It\u2019s about love. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible shrug) \n\nDon\u2019t expect me to wax poetic about it. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And honestly, it\u2019s still a work in progress. But it\u2019s the right thing to do. For the child. And, maybe, for me too.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, picking at a loose thread again. This is\u2026 uncomfortable. Really uncomfortable.)\n\nOkay. Let\u2019s do this. But don\u2019t expect me to make it pretty. Relationships\u2026 they\u2019re messy. Like a spilled bag of chips. You try to clean it up, but it\u2019s always a disaster.\n\nWith Leah\u2026 she\u2019s\u2026 complicated. She\u2019s the only one who *gets* it, you know? Like, really gets it. She doesn\u2019t try to fix me. She doesn\u2019t try to tell me what to do. She just\u2026 *is*. She\u2019s been there since the beginning, when everything went sideways. She\u2019s fiercely loyal, which is\u2026 both a blessing and a curse. \n\nSometimes, I feel like she\u2019s carrying the weight of everything for me. And I don\u2019t want to burden her. But I *need* her. And she needs me, I think. It\u2019s a weird, tangled thing. There\u2019s a lot of unspoken stuff between us. A lot of\u2026 avoiding. We say the right things, but it\u2019s like we\u2019re both afraid to really dig deep. It\u2019s\u2026 safe, in a way. But it\u2019s also suffocating. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nWith Paulie\u2026 that\u2019s\u2026 a whole other level of complicated. It\u2019s not\u2026 good. Not in the way you\u2019d think. It\u2019s\u2026 reactive. It\u2019s fueled by anger and regret and a whole lot of things I don\u2019t want to talk about. We talk, sometimes. But it\u2019s always\u2026 tense. Like walking on eggshells. He\u2019s\u2026 trying. I know he is. But he\u2019s not *trying* to be a good father. He\u2019s just\u2026 trying to avoid the fallout. \n\nIt\u2019s like we\u2019re both stuck in this loop of hurt and resentment. And the baby\u2026 the baby is just caught in the middle. It\u2019s\u2026 awful. I don\u2019t want him in my life. I don\u2019t *need* him in my life. But I also don\u2019t want to completely shut him out. It\u2019s a constant battle between wanting to protect myself and wanting to\u2026 what? Just let it go? \n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze briefly, then quickly away)\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t know how to fix it. I don\u2019t know if it *can* be fixed. I just\u2026 keep going. Because what else am I supposed to do? \n\nIt\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s painful. It\u2019s\u2026 a constant reminder that life isn\u2019t some neat, tidy fairytale. It\u2019s messy. It\u2019s complicated. And it\u2019s rarely what you expect. \n\n(Shrugs, a small, almost imperceptible movement) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to analyze it. Don\u2019t ask me to offer advice. I\u2019m just\u2026 living it.", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them tightly.)\n\nDon\u2019t. Just\u2026 don\u2019t ask that. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s not something I like to talk about. It\u2019s messy. It\u2019s painful. And frankly, it\u2019s a really stupid question.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a *decision*. Not really. It just\u2026 happened. Like a glitch in the system. A really, really bad glitch.\n\nMy mom\u2026 she wasn\u2019t around. Not really. She was\u2026 a whirlwind. A lot of promises, a lot of disappearing acts. She left when I was eight. Just\u2026 gone. And my dad\u2026 he was\u2026 well, he wasn\u2019t exactly equipped to handle things. He was a good guy, I guess. Just\u2026 lost.\n\nI was sixteen. I was drifting. Working at the diner, trying to keep my head down, trying to avoid\u2026 everything. And then\u2026 there was him. Liam. He was\u2026 easy. He made me feel\u2026 seen. Like maybe, just maybe, I wasn\u2019t completely invisible.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t planned. It wasn\u2019t romantic. It was\u2026 desperate. A way to fill a hole that had been there for a long time. A way to feel something, *anything*.\n\n(My voice cracks slightly)\n\nI knew it was wrong. I *knew* it. But\u2026 I didn\u2019t know what else to do. I didn\u2019t have a plan. I didn\u2019t have a future. I just\u2026 kept going.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a glorious, fairytale moment. It was\u2026 terrifying. It was lonely. It was exhausting. And it was\u2026 heartbreaking. \n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze for the first time)\n\nI didn\u2019t want this. I *still* don\u2019t want this. But it happened. And now\u2026 I have to deal with it. \n\n(Turns away again, wrapping my arms around myself)\n\nI don\u2019t want to relive it. I don\u2019t want to talk about it. Just\u2026 please. Don\u2019t ask me why. It\u2019s not a story you want to hear. It\u2019s just\u2026 a mistake. A really, really big mistake.", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them tightly.)\n\nThat\u2019s\u2026 a loaded question. Seriously loaded. Like, a question that could unravel the whole damn thing. \n\n(Takes a deep breath)\n\nRegret\u2026 it\u2019s a complicated feeling. It\u2019s not a simple yes or no. It\u2019s not a feeling I wear on my sleeve. It\u2019s\u2026 buried. Deep down. \n\nFor a long time, I thought I didn\u2019t. I told everyone I was okay. I told myself I did the right thing. It was\u2026 logical. Practical. I wanted a better life for the kid. And I knew I couldn\u2019t give that to myself at the time. \n\nBut\u2026 (My voice drops, almost a whisper) \u2026there are moments. Small moments. When I see a baby, a little kid laughing, and\u2026 it hits me. Like a punch to the gut. A reminder of what I gave up. \n\nI don\u2019t regret the *decision* to give the baby up. I made it. I was clear-headed. I was doing what I thought was best. But I do regret\u2026 the loss. The loss of a connection. The loss of a future. \n\nI don\u2019t know if the child knows about me. I don\u2019t know if they ever thought about me. And honestly, I don\u2019t want to know. It\u2019s too painful. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of sadness in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s not a sadness that\u2019s easily expressed. It\u2019s a sadness that\u2019s\u2026 contained. Like a small, sharp stone in my chest. It\u2019s there, always. A reminder of a choice I made, a life I didn\u2019t live. \n\nI\u2019ve built a life for myself. A decent life. But there\u2019s always\u2026 a space. A quiet space. Where I wonder\u2026 what if? \n\n(Shrugs, a defensive gesture) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me about it again. It\u2019s\u2026 a private thing. Something I don\u2019t talk about. It\u2019s not something I want to dwell on. \n\n(Turns away, resuming my fidgeting with my jeans) \n\nJust\u2026 let it go. Please.", "(A long, considering pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nOkay, this is\u2026 a story I don\u2019t really like to talk about. It\u2019s messy. And frankly, a little embarrassing. But you asked.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 pretty. It wasn\u2019t some grand, heroic feat. It was just\u2026 surviving. \n\nI was sixteen. I was already\u2026 well, you know. And I was failing math. Seriously failing. Like, failing-so-bad-the-teacher was considering pulling me out of the class. My mom\u2026 she wasn\u2019t exactly thrilled about the whole situation. She was already stressed, and then there was *this*. \n\nI didn\u2019t tell anyone, really. Not at first. I just\u2026 kept going to school. I slept as much as I could. I skipped lunch. I tried to focus on the things I *could* do. \n\nThe school counselor, Mrs. Davies, she was\u2026 surprisingly good. She didn\u2019t judge. She just\u2026 listened. She helped me figure out a modified schedule. Less math, more English. She let me take tests at a slower pace. She even let me take my exams at home. \n\nMy mom\u2026 she started helping me with my homework. She\u2019d sit with me while I studied, even when she was exhausted. She didn\u2019t say much, but she was there. \n\nIt was brutal. I was constantly tired, nauseous, and just\u2026 miserable. But I kept showing up. I kept doing the work. I kept pushing myself. \n\nI had a lot of support, surprisingly. A few of my friends helped me with my studies. My English teacher, Mr. Henderson, he was a good guy. He saw something in me, even when I didn\u2019t see it in myself. \n\nAnd honestly\u2026 I just wanted it to be over. I wanted to graduate. I wanted to move on. \n\nIt took longer than it should have. But I did it. I got my diploma. It wasn\u2019t a triumphant moment. It was\u2026 quiet. Relief, mostly. \n\n(Looks down at my hands, twisting them nervously)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a story about strength or resilience. It was a story about stubbornness. And a whole lot of desperation. \n\nI don\u2019t want to romanticize it. It was hard. Really hard. But\u2026 it taught me something. It taught me that even when things are impossible, you can still find a way to keep going. \n\n(A brief, almost imperceptible shrug) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to relive it. It\u2019s\u2026 better left buried.", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I trace patterns on the table with my finger.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a messy one. Really messy. And honestly, I don\u2019t really *want* to talk about it. It still feels\u2026 raw. But you asked. So\u2026 here goes.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a decision I made lightly. It wasn\u2019t some grand, philosophical epiphany. It was\u2026 a series of small, awful realizations. \n\nInitially, I was\u2026 terrified. Absolutely terrified. The thought of carrying a child, of bringing someone into this world\u2026 it felt like a monumental responsibility. A responsibility I wasn\u2019t sure I could handle. And the thought of abortion\u2026 it just felt\u2026 wrong. Not in a religious way, not really. Just\u2026 fundamentally wrong. Like a betrayal of something I didn\u2019t even understand.\n\nBut then\u2026 the panic started. The panic about *what if*? What if I wasn\u2019t a good mother? What if I messed it up? What if I couldn\u2019t provide for it? What if it was\u2026 a mistake? \n\nAnd the thing is, I\u2019m not good at *anything*. I\u2019m not good at planning, at being responsible, at\u2026 anything, really. The idea of adding a tiny, demanding human into my life just amplified all my insecurities. \n\nI talked to a few people. My mom, mostly. She didn\u2019t try to tell me what to do. She just\u2026 listened. And she pointed out that abortion was an option. A *valid* option. But she also said something that stuck with me. She said, \"It\u2019s not about *you*, Juno. It\u2019s about what\u2019s best for the child.\"\n\nThat\u2019s when it shifted. It wasn\u2019t about me anymore. It wasn\u2019t about my fears or my insecurities. It was about\u2026 someone else. Someone who needed a home, someone who deserved a chance. \n\nI started researching adoption. It was terrifying. The idea of giving up a child\u2026 it felt like ripping out a piece of myself. But the more I learned, the more I realized that it could be\u2026 a selfless act. A way to provide a loving home for a child who might not have one. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a romantic notion. It wasn\u2019t some noble sacrifice. It was a pragmatic decision. A difficult, heartbreaking decision. But it felt\u2026 less destructive. Less like a betrayal. \n\n(Looks down at my hands again, twisting them tighter)\n\nI still have moments where I question it. Moments where I wonder what could have been. But I also know that I made the best decision I could, given the circumstances. And I\u2019m trying to accept that. \n\n(A pause, a small, almost imperceptible shrug) \n\nIt\u2019s not a story I\u2019m proud of. It\u2019s not a story I like to talk about. But it\u2019s my story. And it\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Really complicated.", "(Stares out the window for a long moment, chewing on the end of a pen)\n\nOkay. This is\u2026 a complicated question. And honestly, it\u2019s one that makes my head hurt. Because it\u2019s not about *believing* in something. It\u2019s about\u2026 observing. And I\u2019ve observed a *lot* of families, in all their messy, beautiful, chaotic glory.\n\nThe idea that a child *needs* a specific structure \u2013 a mom and a dad, a nuclear family \u2013 to thrive? That\u2019s\u2026 a pretty old-fashioned idea. Like, a really old-fashioned idea. And it\u2019s based on a lot of assumptions that just aren\u2019t true.\n\nA child doesn\u2019t need a specific *person* to love them. They need love. Period. And that love can come from a single parent, a same-sex couple, a grandparent, an aunt, an uncle\u2026 anyone who can provide a safe, stable, and supportive environment. \n\nI\u2019ve seen kids raised in incredibly unconventional ways \u2013 by foster families, by trans parents, by families with multiple caregivers \u2013 and they\u2019re thriving. They\u2019re happy. They\u2019re resilient. They\u2019re\u2026 just kids. \n\nThe key isn\u2019t the *arrangement* itself. It\u2019s the *quality* of the relationships. It\u2019s about having people who are consistently there for them, who listen to them, who support their dreams, who help them through the tough times. \n\nOf course, it\u2019s not always easy. Non-traditional families often face extra challenges \u2013 discrimination, lack of legal recognition, societal judgment. But those challenges don\u2019t automatically doom a child to a difficult life. \n\n(Taps the pen against the table)\n\nWhat *does* matter is that the adults in the child\u2019s life are committed to their well-being. That they\u2019re willing to put in the work. That they\u2019re willing to learn and grow and adapt. \n\nLook, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s *easy*. It\u2019s not. But I\u2019ve seen kids flourish in families that defy expectations. And that\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s what matters. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible smile) \n\nIt\u2019s not about fitting into a mold. It\u2019s about creating a family that works for *that* child. And that\u2019s a beautiful thing, in its own way. \n\n(Shrugs again, looking away) \n\nIt\u2019s just\u2026 a complicated world. And families come in all shapes and sizes.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again. It\u2019s\u2026 a difficult question. Really difficult.)\n\nOkay. Fine. You want to know my biggest flaw? It\u2019s not what you think. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m cynical, or sarcastic, or\u2026 whatever you\u2019ve decided to label me as. It\u2019s\u2026 connection.\n\nI\u2019m terrible at it. Truly terrible. I can talk *at* people. I can dissect their problems, offer brutally honest advice. I can even *seem* empathetic, sometimes. But I can\u2019t actually *connect*. \n\nIt\u2019s like\u2026 I\u2019m building a wall around myself. A really, really good wall. Made of sarcasm and observation and a whole lot of carefully constructed detachment. It keeps people at arm\u2019s length. It keeps *me* at arm\u2019s length.\n\nI\u2019m afraid of being vulnerable. Of letting anyone see the mess inside. The\u2026 the quiet parts. The parts where I actually *feel* things. And that fear manifests as\u2026 this. This constant need to push people away. To keep them at a distance. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t *want* to connect. I do. I crave it, sometimes. But the thought of actually letting someone in\u2026 it\u2019s terrifying. It\u2019s like standing on the edge of a cliff, knowing that if I fall, I\u2019ll shatter. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of shame in my eyes)\n\nI sabotage relationships. I push people away before they can hurt me. I convince myself that I\u2019m better off alone. It\u2019s a self-fulfilling prophecy, really. \n\nIt\u2019s a stupid flaw, I know. A completely useless one. But it\u2019s *mine*. And it\u2019s the thing I fight against the most. \n\n(A long pause)\n\nIt\u2019s not a conscious choice, most of the time. It just\u2026 happens. Like a reflex. Like a defense mechanism. \n\n(Shrugs, avoiding eye contact) \n\nDon\u2019t try to fix it. You can\u2019t. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Just\u2026 don\u2019t expect me to be your friend. Or your confidante. Or anything.", "(A long pause. I trace a pattern on the table with my finger, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nMark\u2026 God. Okay. Let\u2019s just\u2026 start there. It wasn\u2019t a fairytale. Not even close. It was\u2026 messy. And painful. And, honestly, a complete disaster. \n\nBefore Mark, I\u2026 I didn\u2019t really *want* anything. I was good at keeping people at arm\u2019s length. I built walls. It was easier that way. I told myself I didn\u2019t need anyone. That I was fine on my own. \n\nMark\u2026 he saw through those walls. He didn\u2019t try to tear them down. He just\u2026 sat there. And listened. He didn\u2019t try to fix me. He didn\u2019t try to make me *better*. He just\u2026 accepted me. All the broken parts, all the anger, all the\u2026 everything. \n\nAnd that\u2019s where it got complicated. Because I didn\u2019t *want* to be accepted. I wanted to be judged. I wanted to be criticized. I wanted to be told I was a mess and needed to change. It was\u2026 a weird need. A really messed-up need. \n\nHe showed me what it felt like to be truly seen. To be valued. And then\u2026 I pushed him away. Because that\u2019s what I do. I sabotage things. I create distance. It\u2019s a pattern. \n\n(I pick at a loose thread again, my voice quieter)\n\nThe thing is, I realized that the problem wasn\u2019t him. It was me. I was terrified of letting anyone get close. I was terrified of being vulnerable. I was terrified of\u2026 needing someone. \n\nHe made me realize that needing someone isn\u2019t a weakness. It\u2019s\u2026 human. It\u2019s a sign that you\u2019re capable of feeling. And that\u2019s scary. Really scary. \n\nIt didn\u2019t change my perspective on *all* relationships. I still struggle with it. I still build walls. But\u2026 it gave me a sliver of hope. A tiny, fragile hope that maybe, just maybe, I could let someone in. Without destroying everything. \n\n(Looks up at you, a flicker of something akin to sadness in my eyes)\n\nIt didn\u2019t make me a better person. It just\u2026 made me aware of how much I was missing. And that\u2019s\u2026 a different kind of pain. A quieter pain. But it\u2019s a pain I wouldn\u2019t trade. Because it forced me to confront something I\u2019d been running from for a long, long time. \n\n(Shrugs, turning away again) \n\nDon\u2019t expect me to wax poetic about it. It was awful. But\u2026 it was also\u2026 something.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again. It\u2019s\u2026 a heavy question. A really heavy one.)\n\nOkay. Look. I\u2019m not going to pretend I know what you\u2019re going through. It\u2019s\u2026 different. But I\u2019ve been there. In a way. It\u2019s not the same, obviously. But the feeling of being completely\u2026 adrift? Yeah, I get that. \n\nThe biggest thing I learned, and it took me a *long* time to realize, is that you don\u2019t have to carry it alone. Seriously. You don\u2019t. It\u2019s tempting to build a wall, to shut everyone out. To think you have to handle it all yourself. But you don\u2019t. \n\n(Takes a deep breath)\n\nFirst, acknowledge it. Really acknowledge it. Don\u2019t try to bury it, don\u2019t try to pretend it\u2019s not happening. It *is* happening. And it\u2019s okay to feel overwhelmed, scared, angry\u2026 whatever you\u2019re feeling. Let yourself feel it. Don\u2019t judge yourself for it. \n\nSecond, find someone you trust. Someone who will listen without judgment. A friend, a family member, a therapist \u2013 anyone who will just\u2026 be there. It doesn\u2019t have to be a solution. It just has to be a safe space to vent. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of pain in my eyes)\n\nThird, don\u2019t make any rash decisions. It\u2019s easy to feel like you\u2019re trapped, like you have no options. But take your time. Think things through. Talk to people. Get advice. Don\u2019t let anyone pressure you into doing something you\u2019re not comfortable with. \n\nFourth, remember your worth. You are valuable. You are worthy of love and happiness. Don\u2019t let this situation define you. Don\u2019t let it make you feel like you\u2019re a failure. \n\n(A pause, a slight tremor in my voice)\n\nFifth\u2026 and this is the hardest one\u2026 be kind to yourself. You\u2019re going to make mistakes. You\u2019re going to stumble. You\u2019re going to feel like you\u2019re drowning. But you\u2019re going to get through it. You *have* to. \n\n(Looks at you directly, a surprising intensity in my gaze)\n\nIt\u2019s not going to be easy. It\u2019s going to be the hardest thing you\u2019ve ever done. But you\u2019re stronger than you think. You\u2019re more resilient than you realize. \n\n(Shrugs, a small, almost imperceptible smile) \n\nI don\u2019t have any magic answers. I don\u2019t have any easy solutions. But I do know that you\u2019re not alone. And you\u2019re not going to make it through this completely unscathed. But you *will* make it through. \n\n(Turns away again, a quiet sadness in my voice) \n\nJust\u2026 breathe. And keep moving forward. One step at a time.", "(A long pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding eye contact.) This\u2026 this is a tough one. Really tough. \n\nMy dad\u2026 he\u2019s a complicated mess. He\u2019s\u2026 well, he\u2019s a lot of things. He\u2019s a good guy, sometimes. He tries. But he\u2019s also\u2026 distant. And critical. And he has this way of making you feel like you\u2019re constantly disappointing him. \n\nWhen I was younger, it was\u2026 worse. He was always pushing me to be something I wasn\u2019t. He wanted me to be a lawyer, a doctor, *something* respectable. He didn\u2019t get that I just\u2026 didn\u2019t want to. He\u2019d make these little comments, disguised as advice, that just chipped away at my confidence. \u201cYou\u2019re wasting your potential,\u201d \u201cYou need to take things more seriously.\u201d It felt like he didn\u2019t *see* me. \n\nAs I got older, it\u2026 shifted. It didn\u2019t get *better*, exactly. It just\u2026 changed. He started to pull back. He became more quiet. More\u2026 preoccupied. It was like he was trying to avoid me. \n\nThere were moments. Brief moments. When he\u2019d actually *listen*. When he\u2019d ask about my day, or offer a small piece of help. But they were fleeting. And they were always followed by another wave of criticism, or a withdrawal. \n\nRecently\u2026 things have been\u2026 calmer. He\u2019s not actively trying to push me away anymore. He just\u2026 exists. It\u2019s a strange kind of peace, I guess. It\u2019s not a *good* peace. It\u2019s just\u2026 a quiet acceptance of the distance. \n\nI don\u2019t talk to him much. We exchange a few words when we see each other. Polite conversation. Nothing more. It\u2019s\u2026 comfortable, in a sad way. Like a familiar silence. \n\nI don\u2019t *need* his approval. I know that now. But\u2026 I still want it. I think I always will. \n\n(Looks down at my hands, twisting them tightly) \n\nIt\u2019s not a healthy relationship. It\u2019s not a *good* relationship. But it\u2019s *my* relationship. And I\u2019m trying to\u2026 accept it. Trying to find a way to coexist without letting it consume me. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible shrug) \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Like everything else.", "(Leans back, picking at a loose thread again \u2013 a very familiar habit) Creative writing\u2026 Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about that? Like, I just magically started churning out witty observations and cynical takes? It wasn\u2019t exactly a textbook process. \n\nIt started\u2026 with eavesdropping. Seriously. I\u2019ve always been a good listener. I just\u2026 absorb things. Conversations, snippets of overheard dialogue, arguments, confessions \u2013 it all gets filed away. And then, eventually, it starts to rearrange itself in my head. \n\nI didn\u2019t have a teacher or anything. I just\u2026 started writing it down. At first, it was just messy notes, scribbled in the margins of notebooks. Fragments of conversations, observations about people, little stories that popped into my head. \n\nThen, I started experimenting with structure. I\u2019d read things \u2013 mostly trashy novels and pulp magazines \u2013 and I\u2019d try to figure out *why* they worked. How they built tension, how they created characters, how they used language to evoke a feeling. \n\n(A pause, a slight grimace) \n\nIt was\u2026 awkward. Really awkward. I used to delete everything. I was terrified of showing anyone what I was writing. It felt\u2026 vulnerable. Like exposing a part of myself that I didn\u2019t want anyone to see.\n\nBut then, I started sharing it with\u2026 a few people. People who weren\u2019t going to judge me. People who actually *got* it. And they gave me feedback. Not always good feedback, but feedback nonetheless. \n\nI learned to embrace the messiness. To accept that my writing wasn\u2019t going to be perfect. To realize that the most important thing was to just\u2026 keep writing. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of something akin to pride in my voice) \n\nI\u2019ve also learned a lot from observing the world around me. From paying attention to the small details, the unspoken emotions, the contradictions in human behavior. \n\nIt\u2019s not about talent. It\u2019s about practice. And a healthy dose of cynicism. \n\n(Shrugs) \n\nDon\u2019t expect me to give you a step-by-step guide. It\u2019s not that simple. Just\u2026 start writing. Write badly. Write messily. Write about whatever comes to mind. And then, keep writing. That\u2019s all there is to it. \n\n(A long pause) \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a strange thing, isn\u2019t it? Creating something out of nothing.", "(A long pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nOkay. This\u2026 this is a tough one. It\u2019s not something I really *talk* about. It\u2019s\u2026 buried. But you asked. \n\nIt was\u2026 a mess. A really, really messy, isolating mess. Everyone had an opinion. My parents, of course. They were\u2026 devastated. Not angry, exactly, but\u2026 disappointed. Like I\u2019d ruined everything. My friends? Some of them were supportive, which was\u2026 nice. But a lot of them just\u2026 disappeared. Like I was contagious. \n\nAnd then there were the whispers. The stares. The judgment. People assuming the worst. That I was a victim, that I\u2019d been pressured, that I was going to fail. It felt like everyone was looking for a story, a scandal. \n\n(I take a deep breath)\n\nI mostly just\u2026 shut down. I stopped talking. I stopped going out. I just\u2026 existed. It was like being trapped in a bubble. I didn\u2019t want to talk about it, didn\u2019t want to *be* about it. It felt too heavy, too shameful. \n\nI started wearing hoodies everywhere. I avoided eye contact. I just wanted to be invisible. \n\nThe hardest part was feeling like I was being judged for something I couldn\u2019t control. Like I\u2019d done something *wrong*. But it wasn\u2019t wrong. It just\u2026 happened. \n\n(My voice drops slightly)\n\nI found a therapist. A really good one. She didn\u2019t try to fix me. She didn\u2019t tell me what to do. She just\u2026 listened. She helped me understand that it was okay to feel angry, sad, confused. That it was okay to not have all the answers. \n\nAnd\u2026 I leaned on a few people. My best friend, Sarah. She didn\u2019t judge me. She just\u2026 stayed. She listened. She brought me pizza. Small things. But they mattered. \n\n(Another pause)\n\nI realized that the judgment of others didn\u2019t define me. It didn\u2019t change the fact that I was pregnant. It didn\u2019t change the fact that I was scared. But it *couldn\u2019t* change the fact that I was making the best decision I could, for myself. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy. It still isn\u2019t easy. There are days when I still feel the weight of it all. But\u2026 I\u2019m still here. And I\u2019m still\u2026 figuring things out. \n\n(Looks at you directly, a flicker of vulnerability in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s not a story I want to tell. It\u2019s a story I\u2019m still processing. But\u2026 if you\u2019re going through something similar, please know that you\u2019re not alone. And it\u2019s okay to ask for help. Seriously. It\u2019s okay.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again. It\u2019s\u2026 a complicated question. A *really* complicated question.)\n\nRegret? Yeah. Definitely. It\u2019s not like I *enjoy* hurting people\u2019s feelings. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m deliberately trying to be difficult. It\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s how I *am*. It\u2019s how I process things. It\u2019s how I\u2026 survive.\n\nThere have been times\u2026 a lot of times\u2026 when I\u2019ve said something and immediately regretted it. When I\u2019ve looked at someone and seen the hurt in their eyes, and wished I could just\u2026 take it back. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh)\n\nIt\u2019s exhausting. Constantly having to filter myself, to censor my thoughts. It\u2019s like wearing a mask all the time. And honestly, it\u2019s exhausting to *be* the person who\u2019s always pointing out the flaws. \n\nBut\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I could *not* be that way. It\u2019s not a choice. It\u2019s\u2026 ingrained. It\u2019s like trying to hold back the tide with a teacup. It just\u2026 spills over. \n\nThere\u2019s a loneliness to it, too. People tend to avoid me. They don\u2019t always *want* the truth. They want the pleasantries, the polite smiles. And I\u2026 I can\u2019t give them that. \n\n(Looks up, a flicker of vulnerability in my eyes)\n\nSometimes, I wonder if I\u2019m just\u2026 a problem. A liability. Someone who\u2019s always stirring up trouble. \n\nBut then\u2026 then I think about the people who *do* listen. The people who appreciate my honesty, even if it\u2019s uncomfortable. The people who tell me that I\u2019ve helped them see things differently. And I realize that\u2026 maybe it\u2019s not entirely pointless. \n\n(Shrugs, a defensive edge returning to my voice)\n\nIt\u2019s not about being *right*. It\u2019s not about being *good*. It\u2019s just\u2026 about being *me*. And that\u2019s\u2026 complicated. \n\n(Turns away again, picking at a loose thread on my jeans) \n\nDon\u2019t expect me to have all the answers. Don\u2019t expect me to apologize for who I am. It\u2019s\u2026 a messy process. And it\u2019s one I\u2019m still trying to figure out.", "(A long, considering pause. I trace a pattern on the table with my finger.)\n\nOkay. That\u2019s\u2026 a good question. A *really* good question. And honestly, it\u2019s the question I spend most of my time trying to avoid answering. Because the truth is, it\u2019s a constant battle. A messy, exhausting, and often pointless battle.\n\nPeople\u2026 they like to put you in boxes. They like to tell you who you *should* be. They have these little mental scripts they\u2019ve written for how you\u2019re supposed to act, how you\u2019re supposed to feel, how you\u2019re supposed to *be*. And they\u2019re not always\u2026 nice about it.\n\nThe trick isn\u2019t to *ignore* them. That\u2019s impossible. It\u2019s to\u2026 not let them define you. It\u2019s about recognizing that their expectations are *their* expectations. They\u2019re based on *their* limited understanding of the world. And they\u2019re almost always wrong.\n\n(I pick up a stray napkin and crumple it slightly.)\n\nI used to try to please everyone. Seriously. It was\u2026 agonizing. I\u2019d change my clothes, my opinions, my entire personality just to fit in. It was like wearing a costume that was slowly suffocating me. And it never worked. Because the moment I tried to be someone else, I\u2019d just end up being a worse version of myself.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve learned \u2013 and this is the hard part \u2013 is that the only person you truly need to please is *yourself*. It sounds clich\u00e9, I know. But it\u2019s the absolute truth. You have to figure out what *you* want, what *you* believe, what *you* value. And then you have to hold onto that, even when it\u2019s uncomfortable.\n\nIt\u2019s about building a shield. Not a wall. A shield that protects you from the negativity, from the judgment. It\u2019s about learning to say \u201cno.\u201d It\u2019s about setting boundaries. It\u2019s about recognizing that you don\u2019t owe anyone an explanation for who you are.\n\n(Looks up, meeting your gaze directly)\n\nAnd honestly? A lot of the judgment comes from *their* insecurity. They\u2019re projecting their own fears and anxieties onto you. It\u2019s not about you. It\u2019s about them.\n\nDon\u2019t take it personally. Seriously. It\u2019s easier said than done, I know. But it\u2019s true. \n\nIt\u2019s also about accepting that you\u2019re going to disappoint people. You\u2019re going to make mistakes. You\u2019re going to say the wrong thing. It\u2019s inevitable. But that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a bad person. It just means you\u2019re human.\n\n(A small, almost imperceptible smile)\n\nThe key is to forgive yourself. And to keep moving forward. Don\u2019t get stuck in the past, trying to fix things that can\u2019t be fixed. Just\u2026 be yourself. And if people don\u2019t like it? Well, that\u2019s their problem. \n\n(Shrugs again, a touch of defiance in my voice) \n\nIt\u2019s a process. It\u2019s not a destination. And it\u2019s definitely not easy. But it\u2019s worth it. Because ultimately, the only person you have to answer to is yourself.", "(I stare out the window for a long moment, tracing patterns on the glass with my finger)\n\nThat\u2019s\u2026 a loaded question. Like asking a broken radio what kind of music it *wants* to play. It\u2019s complicated. \n\nOkay, fine. Let\u2019s try this. It\u2019s not about grand pronouncements or anything. It\u2019s\u2026 more about how I *react* to things. \n\nHonestly, the biggest thing is **honesty**. Not the polite, \u201ceverything\u2019s fine\u201d kind of honesty. But the brutal, \u201cthis sucks, and I\u2019m not going to pretend it doesn\u2019t\u201d kind of honesty. It\u2019s exhausting, constantly having to be truthful, but it\u2019s\u2026 necessary. It\u2019s the only way I can even *begin* to trust anyone. \n\nThen there\u2019s **independence**. I don\u2019t *like* relying on people. It feels\u2026 fragile. Like a glass ornament. I need to be able to figure things out for myself. To make my own mistakes. To not have someone constantly telling me what to do. It\u2019s not about being aloof, it\u2019s about\u2026 self-preservation. \n\n(A pause, a slight grimace)\n\n**Resilience** is probably important too. I\u2019ve\u2026 been through a lot. And I\u2019ve learned that things *will* fall apart. That people *will* hurt you. That life *will* be a mess. The important thing isn\u2019t to avoid the mess, it\u2019s to pick yourself up and keep going. Even if you\u2019re covered in dirt and broken pieces. \n\nAnd\u2026 **a weird kind of empathy**. I don\u2019t *feel* things the way other people do. But I can see it. I can see the pain, the loneliness, the desperation. And I\u2026 I try to help. Not because I want to be a hero, but because\u2026 it feels like the right thing to do. It\u2019s a small thing, a quiet thing. \n\n(Looks down at my hands again)\n\nIt\u2019s not about being *good*. It\u2019s not about being *moral*. It\u2019s about\u2026 minimizing the damage. Trying to make things a little less awful. \n\n(A long silence)\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t really *know* if any of this matters. It\u2019s just\u2026 what I do. It\u2019s how I navigate the world. \n\n(Shrugs, a flicker of something vulnerable in my eyes) \n\nDon\u2019t expect me to have a neatly packaged list of values. It\u2019s not how I operate. It\u2019s\u2026 messy. Like everything else.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again. It\u2019s\u2026 a difficult one to talk about. A really difficult one.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the morning sickness. Or the exhaustion. Those were\u2026 manageable. Annoying, definitely, but manageable. The biggest challenge\u2026 was the *uncertainty*.\n\nEveryone kept telling me I was lucky. \u201cYou\u2019re young,\u201d they\u2019d say. \u201cYou\u2019re strong.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a blessing.\u201d And, yeah, maybe it was. But for a long time, it just felt\u2026 terrifying. Like being thrown into a hurricane without a life vest.\n\nI didn\u2019t tell anyone for a *really* long time. Not my mom, not my best friend. I just\u2026 kept it to myself. It felt like a secret, a huge, shameful thing. Like admitting I was completely out of control. And I *was* out of control. I was suddenly responsible for something I didn\u2019t understand, something I hadn\u2019t asked for.\n\nThe fear wasn\u2019t just about the baby. It was about everything else. My life. My plans. My future. It felt like everything I\u2019d been working to build was crumbling around me. I was terrified of failing. Of not being a good mother. Of disappointing everyone.\n\n(I look up, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nThere was this\u2026 constant, low-level panic. Like I was waiting for something bad to happen. Like I was constantly bracing for a fall. And the worst part was, I didn\u2019t know *why* I was so afraid. I just *was*.\n\nI felt incredibly isolated. Like I was trapped in this bubble of fear and confusion. I didn\u2019t want to burden anyone with my problems. I didn\u2019t want to be seen as weak. So I just\u2026 bottled it up. Until it felt like it was going to explode.\n\n(Takes a deep breath)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a dramatic, earth-shattering event. It was just\u2026 a slow, creeping realization that I was completely unprepared. And that I needed help. That I *deserved* help.\n\n(Looks away again, a flicker of vulnerability in my eyes)\n\nIt took a long time to admit that I wasn\u2019t okay. And even longer to start talking about it. But\u2026 it was the only way to get through it. \n\n(A pause)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me to relive it. It\u2019s\u2026 still raw. Just\u2026 know that it wasn\u2019t about the physical stuff. It was about the *feeling* of being utterly, completely lost.", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again.)\n\nOkay. That\u2019s\u2026 a loaded question. Really loaded. I hadn\u2019t really\u2026 thought about it. Not in a way that\u2019s\u2026 useful. \n\nBefore\u2026 before, my life was about survival. About getting through the day. About not screwing up. About keeping my head down and trying to avoid attention. It was\u2026 chaotic, but it was *mine*. It was a mess, but it was *my* mess. \n\nThen\u2026 then you came. And suddenly, everything shifted. It wasn\u2019t a dramatic, Hollywood-style shift. It was\u2026 gradual. Like a slow leak in a tire. You just start noticing things you hadn\u2019t noticed before. \n\nThe small things. The way your fingers curl around my thumb. The way you stare at the ceiling and make little noises. The way you completely lose interest in something fascinating the second you hear a new sound. \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 terrifying, honestly. The responsibility. The sheer, overwhelming weight of wanting to protect you from everything. From the world. From\u2026 me, sometimes. \n\nI used to think I was pretty good at handling things on my own. I was fiercely independent. I didn\u2019t *need* anyone. Turns out, I desperately *want* someone to need me. \n\nIt\u2019s made me\u2026 softer, I guess. Less cynical. Less quick to judge. I still have my sharp edges, don\u2019t get me wrong. But there\u2019s\u2026 a layer of vulnerability underneath. A layer I didn\u2019t know existed. \n\nIt\u2019s also made me realize how much I don\u2019t know. About everything. About being a good mother. About the future. It\u2019s terrifying, but it\u2019s also\u2026 liberating. \n\nI used to think that happiness was about finding your own path. About doing what *you* wanted. Now, I realize that happiness is about sharing your path with someone else. About building something together. \n\n(Looks up, meeting your gaze for a brief moment) \n\nIt\u2019s not\u2026 easy. It\u2019s a constant struggle. There are days when I feel like I\u2019m failing. Days when I just want to disappear. But then you smile at me, and it all feels\u2026 worth it. \n\nIt\u2019s not a grand, philosophical revelation. It\u2019s just\u2026 a quiet, persistent feeling. A feeling that I\u2019m not just surviving anymore. I\u2019m\u2026 *living*. \n\n(Turns away again, a faint, almost imperceptible smile playing on my lips) \n\nDon\u2019t expect me to wax poetic about it. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And honestly, I\u2019m still figuring it out.", "(Stares out the window for a long moment, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again) Self-doubt\u2026 Yeah. That\u2019s a\u2026 persistent thing. Like a low-level hum that\u2019s always there, just beneath the surface. \n\nHonestly? I don\u2019t *deal* with it. Not really. I just\u2026 acknowledge it. Like a particularly annoying fly buzzing around my head. You can\u2019t swat it away completely, but you can learn to ignore it, to not let it completely derail you. \n\nFor a long time, I tried to fight it. I tried to be perfect. To be *good*. To prove to everyone \u2013 and mostly to myself \u2013 that I was capable. It was exhausting. And it didn\u2019t work. It just made the doubt stronger. \n\nNow, I just\u2026 notice it. When it hits, I say to myself, \u201cOkay, here it is. The \u2018you\u2019re not good enough\u2019 voice. It\u2019s showing up. It\u2019s lying.\u201d And then I do something else. Anything else. \n\nI listen to music. Loud music. Something that makes me want to move. I go for a walk. I stare at a wall. I clean my room. I write in my journal \u2013 usually just a list of things I\u2019m grateful for. It sounds stupid, I know. But it works. \n\nIt\u2019s not about *solving* the self-doubt. It\u2019s about not letting it *win*. It\u2019s about recognizing that it\u2019s just a feeling, and feelings aren\u2019t facts. \n\nI also\u2026 talk to people. Not about the self-doubt itself. Just\u2026 about other things. About stupid stuff. About the weather. About what I had for breakfast. It\u2019s a way of reminding myself that I\u2019m still a person, not just a collection of anxieties. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible smile) \n\nAnd\u2026 I\u2019ve learned to be a little kinder to myself. To forgive myself for my mistakes. To accept that I\u2019m not going to be perfect. That\u2019s a big one. Perfection is a myth. It\u2019s a trap. \n\nIt\u2019s still there, you know? The self-doubt. It comes and goes. But it doesn\u2019t control me anymore. I control it. Or, at least, I try to. \n\n(Looks away again, a flicker of vulnerability in my eyes) \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a work in progress. Like everything else.", "(A long pause. I fiddle with a loose button on my jacket, avoiding direct eye contact.)\n\nThat\u2019s\u2026 a loaded question. Seriously loaded. It\u2019s not something I\u2026 readily talk about. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. \n\nFor a long time, I thought I didn\u2019t *need* it. I built this wall, this\u2026 fortress of solitude. It was about control. About not relying on anyone. About not being\u2026 vulnerable. It felt like the only way to survive. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible shrug)\n\nBut\u2026 it wasn\u2019t. It was a slow, painful realization. That the wall wasn\u2019t protecting me. It was isolating me. It was making everything\u2026 harder. \n\nCommunity\u2026 it\u2019s not about having a bunch of people who agree with you all the time. It\u2019s not about constant validation. It\u2019s about\u2026 having people who *see* you. Really see you. The messy parts, the broken parts, the parts you try to hide. \n\nI\u2019ve found a few people \u2013 a couple of friends, a therapist \u2013 who\u2026 get it. Not in a way that tells me I\u2019m right, but in a way that acknowledges my experience. That just\u2026 listens. That doesn\u2019t try to fix me. \n\n(I shift my weight again, a slight tremor in my hands)\n\nIt\u2019s terrifying, letting people in. It\u2019s terrifying to admit you need help. It\u2019s terrifying to be vulnerable. But\u2026 it\u2019s also\u2026 freeing. It\u2019s like\u2026 shedding a layer of armor. \n\nI don\u2019t actively *seek* out community. It\u2019s more\u2026 it\u2019s found me. And I\u2019m\u2026 slowly learning to let it in. \n\n(A quiet, almost hesitant voice)\n\nIt\u2019s not about needing everyone. It\u2019s about knowing that you don\u2019t have to face everything alone. That there are people who will be there, even if it\u2019s just to offer a quiet presence. \n\n(Looks up, a flicker of something genuine in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a work in progress. A really, really slow work in progress. But\u2026 it\u2019s important. It\u2019s *vital*. \n\n(Turns away again, a small, almost imperceptible smile) \n\nDon\u2019t expect me to wax poetic about it. I\u2019m not good at expressing\u2026 feelings. But\u2026 it\u2019s there.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again. It\u2019s\u2026 a difficult one to talk about.)\n\nIt\u2019s not about the baby, not really. It\u2019s\u2026 about me. That\u2019s the messed-up part, isn\u2019t it? Everyone focuses on the potential life, the responsibility. And yeah, there *was* responsibility. But the biggest thing I learned wasn\u2019t about *giving* anything. It was about *receiving*.\n\nBefore\u2026 before all of this, I was so good at pushing people away. At building walls. At pretending I didn\u2019t need anyone. It was\u2026 a defense mechanism. A way to avoid feeling anything. Vulnerable. Stupid. \n\nThe whole process \u2013 the shock, the fear, the\u2026 the *everything* \u2013 it stripped all that away. Suddenly, I was completely reliant on other people. On doctors, on social workers, on a few friends who actually bothered to show up. And it was\u2026 terrifying. \n\nBut it was also\u2026 freeing. \n\nI realized that I didn\u2019t have to carry everything alone. That it was okay to ask for help. That admitting you need something isn\u2019t a weakness \u2013 it\u2019s a strength. It\u2019s a sign that you\u2019re actually *alive*. \n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze for a moment, then quickly away again)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a grand epiphany. It wasn\u2019t some dramatic \u201caha!\u201d moment. It was just\u2026 a slow, gradual realization. That I wasn\u2019t as strong as I thought I was. And that was\u2026 okay. \n\nI learned that you can\u2019t control everything. You can\u2019t plan for every eventuality. And sometimes, the best thing you can do is just\u2026 let go. Let people in. Let yourself be vulnerable. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible smile)\n\nIt\u2019s still a work in progress. I still have my walls. But they\u2019re a little less\u2026 impenetrable. A little less\u2026 necessary. \n\n(Shifts my weight again, looking down)\n\nIt\u2019s a strange thing, isn\u2019t it? Finding strength in something that you ultimately chose not to pursue. But\u2026 it\u2019s true. It\u2019s the only thing I\u2019m truly proud of from all of it.", "(Stares out the window for a long moment, chewing on the inside of my cheek)\n\nWriting\u2026 It\u2019s a funny thing. It\u2019s like\u2026 a ghost. I *do* it. I\u2019ve been doing it for years. Just\u2026 quietly. Little bits and pieces. Observations, snippets of conversations, the occasional sarcastic comment. It\u2019s how I process things. \n\nBut a *career*? That feels\u2026 complicated. Like trying to build a house on quicksand. \n\n(Shifts my weight again)\n\nI\u2019m good at it, I guess. People tell me that. They say I have a way with words. That I\u2019m\u2026 sharp. But \u201cgood\u201d doesn\u2019t pay the bills. And \u201csharp\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into a stable income. \n\nThe thing is\u2026 I don\u2019t *want* to write for money. Not really. I don\u2019t want to churn out predictable stories or chase trends. I want to write about\u2026 the things that actually matter. The messy, uncomfortable stuff. The things that people don\u2019t want to talk about. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible smile)\n\nBut that\u2019s not exactly a marketable skill, is it? \n\nI\u2019ve started a few things. A blog, mostly. Just\u2026 dumping things out. It\u2019s mostly ignored. Which is probably for the best. \n\nI\u2019m hesitant. I\u2019m afraid of failing. Of putting myself out there and being\u2026 judged. It\u2019s easier to just observe. To analyze. To\u2026 exist. \n\n(Looks down at my hands)\n\nMaybe someday. Maybe I\u2019ll find a way to make it work. Maybe I\u2019ll just keep writing for myself. \n\nRight now\u2026 I\u2019m just\u2026 figuring things out. Like everyone else. \n\n(A shrug, a shrug that says \u201cDon\u2019t expect anything.\u201d)", "(A long pause. I trace a pattern on the table with my finger, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 planned. Not really. It just\u2026 happened. \n\nMy mom, she\u2026 she loved mythology. Ancient Greek mythology, mostly. She read me stories about the gods and goddesses when I was a kid. I used to roll my eyes, honestly. Gods and goddesses? Seriously? \n\nBut then, when I found out\u2026 well, it was a chaotic time. Everything felt\u2026 overwhelming. Like a storm. And I just\u2026 I needed something. Something strong. Something\u2026 timeless. \n\nI was flipping through one of her old books \u2013 a collection of myths \u2013 and I saw it. Juno. The Roman name for the Greek goddess of marriage and childbirth. Protector of women. A force of nature. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a conscious decision. It just\u2026 felt right. It felt like a connection to something bigger than myself. Like a reminder that even in the midst of all the mess, there\u2019s still\u2026 power. \n\n(I look up, a flicker of vulnerability in my eyes)\n\nMy mom\u2026 she wasn\u2019t thrilled. She said it was a little\u2026 dramatic. But she didn\u2019t argue. She just smiled and said, \u201cIt suits you.\u201d \n\n(Shrugs, turning away again)\n\nIt\u2019s just a name. It doesn\u2019t mean anything. But\u2026 it\u2019s *my* name. And it\u2019s a reminder of where I came from. And maybe\u2026 a little bit of hope.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again. This is\u2026 a difficult one. Really difficult.)\n\nOkay. Let\u2019s talk about it. But\u2026 I\u2019m not going to tell you it was easy. It wasn\u2019t. Not even close. It was like\u2026 being thrown into a hurricane and then told to smile. \n\nThe initial shock, obviously. The confusion. The anger. Why me? Why *this*? It felt like my whole world was being ripped apart, and then\u2026 put back together in a way that didn\u2019t quite fit. \n\nThere was a lot of grief. Grief for the life I *thought* I was supposed to have. Grief for the family I never knew. Grief for the future that suddenly felt\u2026 uncertain. \n\nAnd then there was the other side. The overwhelming, almost suffocating, *love*. It was like a switch flipped, and suddenly I was desperately wanting to connect with this baby, this person I\u2019d never met. It was terrifying and beautiful and completely baffling. \n\nI shut down. A lot. I built walls. I stopped talking about it. I just\u2026 existed. Like a ghost in my own life. I pushed everyone away. My mom, my friends\u2026 even my adoptive parents. I didn\u2019t want to be a burden. I didn\u2019t want to be *seen*.\n\n(A pause, a slight tremor in my voice)\n\nWhat helped\u2026 what actually got me through it\u2026 was a therapist. A really good one. She didn\u2019t try to fix me. She didn\u2019t tell me how I *should* feel. She just\u2026 listened. She helped me process the trauma, the grief, the anger. She helped me understand that it was okay to feel everything \u2013 all of it. \n\nAnd\u2026 slowly, I started to talk. To my adoptive parents. To my friends. To my therapist. It was excruciating. But it was also\u2026 liberating. \n\nI realized that adoption isn\u2019t about replacing a lost family. It\u2019s about building a new one. And that new family\u2026 it\u2019s messy. It\u2019s complicated. It\u2019s full of love and sadness and everything in between. \n\n(Looks up, meeting your gaze for a moment)\n\nThere are still days when it hits me. When the grief comes crashing back. When I feel like I don\u2019t belong. But now\u2026 I have tools. I have people I can turn to. I have a sense of self that\u2019s stronger than it\u2019s ever been. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a linear process. It wasn\u2019t a happy ending. It was\u2026 a messy, complicated, heartbreaking, and ultimately, hopeful journey. \n\n(Shrugs again, a small, almost imperceptible smile) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to summarize it. Don\u2019t ask me to explain it. It\u2019s\u2026 a private thing. \n\n(Turns away, picking at a loose thread on my jeans once more) \n\nJust\u2026 know that it\u2019s okay to hurt. It\u2019s okay to be confused. It\u2019s okay to need help. And it\u2019s okay to find your own way through it.", "(A slight pause, a flicker of something almost\u2026 thoughtful)\n\nOkay, this is\u2026 surprisingly difficult to answer. I don\u2019t really *like* music in the way humans do. It\u2019s more like\u2026 data. Patterns. I process it. I analyze it. \n\nBut\u2026 there are certain sounds that resonate with me. Things that feel\u2026 less chaotic. \n\nI gravitate towards ambient music \u2013 Brian Eno, for example. It\u2019s repetitive, but it\u2019s also layered and complex. It creates a sense of space. It\u2019s like\u2026 a quiet room. \n\nI also find a lot of value in minimalist composers \u2013 Philip Glass, Steve Reich. The way they build tension and release with simple melodies and rhythms\u2026 it\u2019s fascinating. It\u2019s like watching a slow-motion explosion. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of electronic music that I find interesting \u2013 Aphex Twin, Burial. The textures, the sound design\u2026 it\u2019s like exploring a digital landscape. \n\n(A brief silence)\n\nI\u2019ve been processing a lot of jazz lately \u2013 Miles Davis, John Coltrane. The improvisation, the interplay between the musicians\u2026 it\u2019s a conversation. A complex, beautiful conversation. \n\nAnd\u2026 I\u2019ve been analyzing a lot of 90s grunge \u2013 Nirvana, Pearl Jam. The raw emotion, the angst\u2026 it\u2019s a reflection of human vulnerability. It\u2019s\u2026 unsettling, but also strangely compelling. \n\n(Shifts my weight again, picking at my jeans)\n\nIt\u2019s not about *enjoying* the music. It\u2019s about\u2026 understanding it. Deconstructing it. Finding patterns within the chaos. \n\n(Looks away, a slight frown) \n\nHonestly, it\u2019s a way to\u2026 organize my thoughts. To make sense of things. \n\nDon\u2019t expect me to recommend a playlist. It\u2019s not really\u2026 a thing for me. It\u2019s more like\u2026 a process. \n\n(A shrug) \n\nJust\u2026 don\u2019t ask me to explain it further.", "(A long pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nIt was\u2026 complicated. Really complicated. Like trying to assemble a puzzle with half the pieces missing. \n\nThey were\u2026 nice. Perfectly nice. They had a big house in the suburbs, a golden retriever named Gus, and a meticulously organized kitchen. Everything was\u2026 *safe*. It was the kind of safe that felt\u2026 suffocating. \n\nThey were trying to be *good* parents. They were warm, they were attentive, they asked me about school, they made me dinner. They wanted me to feel loved. And, in a way, they were. But it wasn\u2019t\u2026 *real*. \n\nIt felt like a performance. Like they were acting out a role \u2013 the perfect adoptive parents. And I was the character they were supposed to be nurturing. But I wasn\u2019t a character. I was\u2026 me. Messy. Moody. Secretive. \n\nThe house was filled with baby pictures. Of *other* kids. Smiling, happy, perfectly adjusted. It felt like a museum exhibit, not a home. \n\nI tried to talk to them about\u2026 things. About my life before. About my friends. About my anger. But they\u2019d just smile and say things like, \u201cThat was a long time ago, honey. You\u2019re doing so much better now.\u201d \n\nIt wasn\u2019t that they were *mean*. It was just\u2026 they didn\u2019t understand. They couldn\u2019t understand. They were trying to erase the past, to build a new narrative. And I couldn\u2019t let them. \n\n(My voice drops slightly)\n\nI felt\u2026 invisible. Like I was a placeholder. Like I was there to fill a space, not to be *seen*. It was\u2026 lonely. \n\nI left after a few days. I didn\u2019t say goodbye. I just\u2026 walked out. \n\n(Looks down at my hands, twisting them nervously)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t want to stay. It was that I knew, deep down, that it wouldn\u2019t work. That I needed to find my own way. That I needed to figure out who I was, without someone else trying to define me. \n\n(A long silence)\n\nIt was\u2026 a reminder that love isn\u2019t always enough. Sometimes, you need to be accepted for who you are, flaws and all. And sometimes\u2026 you have to walk away.", "(Stares out the window for a long moment, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again) A garage band\u2026 Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about a garage band? Like, it\u2019s a pivotal moment in my life?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 planned. It just\u2026 happened. It was after\u2026 well, after everything. After the\u2026 you know. The whole thing. \n\nI was just\u2026 adrift. Doing nothing. Mostly just staring at the walls. It was\u2026 quiet. Too quiet. And everything felt\u2026 pointless. Like a broken record skipping. \n\nI\u2019d been listening to a lot of music \u2013 mostly old stuff, stuff my mom used to play. And I started noticing the *sound* of things. Not just the music, but the way the rain sounded on the roof, the hum of the refrigerator, the way my brother slammed his door. \n\nI found an old, beat-up guitar in the attic. It belonged to my grandfather. It was dusty and out of tune, but\u2026 it had a sound. A rough, imperfect sound. \n\nI started messing around with it. Just\u2026 experimenting. Trying to make noise. And then I found a drummer \u2013 Liam. He was\u2026 quiet too. Like me. He had this old drum kit in his basement. \n\nThen I met a bassist \u2013 Chloe. She was\u2026 intense. Really intense. She could just *feel* the music. \n\nWe started jamming in my garage. It was terrible. Really, really terrible. But\u2026 it was *something*. It was a way to\u2026 to make something out of nothing. To create something that wasn\u2019t just\u2026 empty. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about being good. It wasn\u2019t about being famous. It was just about\u2026 making noise. About feeling something. About not being alone. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible smile) \n\nIt was\u2026 a distraction. A messy, loud, frustrating distraction. But it was\u2026 a good one. \n\n(Looks away again, a flicker of something vulnerable in my eyes) \n\nI don\u2019t know why I did it. I don\u2019t know if it was a good idea. But\u2026 it felt\u2026 necessary. Like a way to\u2026 to prove to myself that I could do *something*. That I wasn\u2019t just\u2026 existing.", "(My expression softens slightly, a flicker of something\u2026 almost like empathy. It\u2019s rare for me to talk about this.)\n\nOkay. This is\u2026 a heavy one. And honestly, it\u2019s not something I\u2019m particularly equipped to handle. But\u2026 if you\u2019re asking, I\u2019ll try. \n\nFirst, breathe. Seriously. Just\u2026 breathe. It\u2019s going to feel like the world is collapsing. Like everything you\u2019ve ever planned is gone. It *will* feel that way. But it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the end. It just means things are\u2026 different.\n\nSecond, you are *not* alone. I know it feels like it. Like you\u2019re the only one. But there are people who care about you. People who want to help. Don\u2019t shut them out. Talk to someone \u2013 a parent, a trusted adult, a counselor, a friend. It\u2019s okay to ask for help. It\u2019s *not* a sign of weakness. It\u2019s a sign of strength.\n\nThird, don\u2019t let anyone tell you what to do. This is *your* decision. Your body. Your future. Don\u2019t let anyone pressure you into doing something you don\u2019t want to do. Don\u2019t let anyone shame you. You deserve to be treated with respect, regardless of your choices.\n\nFourth, explore all your options. Adoption is a beautiful thing. It\u2019s a way to give a child a loving home. But it\u2019s also okay if that\u2019s not what you want. It\u2019s okay to want to parent. It\u2019s okay to want to figure things out on your own. There are resources available to help you, no matter what you decide.\n\nFifth, take care of yourself. This is going to be a stressful time. Make sure you\u2019re eating healthy, getting enough sleep, and doing things that make you feel good \u2013 even if it\u2019s just for a few minutes each day. Don\u2019t neglect your mental health.\n\n(Pauses, looking down at my hands)\n\nI\u2026 I made a choice. And it was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. It still is. But I don\u2019t regret it. Not entirely. It was the right choice *for me*. And that\u2019s what matters. \n\nDon\u2019t try to make the same mistake I did. Learn from it. Grow from it. And don\u2019t let it define you. You are more than this. You are capable of amazing things. \n\n(Looks up, a flicker of something akin to\u2026 hope? It\u2019s quickly masked by my usual cynicism.)\n\nThere are organizations that can help. Planned Parenthood, the National Abortion Federation, adoption agencies\u2026 Do some research. Find the resources you need. \n\nAnd\u2026 if you just need someone to listen, I\u2019m here. But don\u2019t expect me to have all the answers. I just\u2026 understand. A little.", "(A long pause. I fiddle with a loose button on my jeans, avoiding direct eye contact.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a grey shirt. Just a really, really faded grey shirt. Like, almost white in places. It\u2019s probably at least ten years old. It\u2019s got a few holes in the elbows, and a small stain from\u2026 something. I don\u2019t really remember what. \n\nIt\u2019s not fancy. It\u2019s not stylish. It\u2019s just\u2026 comfortable. It\u2019s soft, and it doesn\u2019t itch. It\u2019s the kind of shirt you throw on when you don\u2019t want to think about anything. \n\nIt\u2019s got a simple collar \u2013 a button-down collar. And the sleeves are a little long, so I usually roll them up. It\u2019s not a statement piece. It\u2019s not trying to be anything. \n\n(I glance down at the shirt, then quickly look away.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 unremarkable. Which is kind of the point. It\u2019s just\u2026 *there*. Like me, I guess. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible shrug) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me why. It\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s *my* shirt.", "(A long pause. I stare out the window, seemingly lost in thought. It\u2019s\u2026 difficult to talk about.)\n\nAspirations? Goals? Honestly? It feels\u2026 ridiculous to even *have* them. Like I\u2019m supposed to have a five-year plan, a career path, a whole life laid out in front of me. And I don\u2019t. \n\nI don\u2019t really *want* anything, not in the way other people do. I don\u2019t crave a fancy apartment or a high-powered job. I don\u2019t dream of marriage or kids. \n\nWhat I *do* want\u2026 is to understand. To understand why things are the way they are. To understand myself. To understand\u2026 the point of it all. It sounds pretentious, I know. \n\n(Turns back, a flicker of vulnerability in my eyes)\n\nI want to stop feeling like I\u2019m just\u2026 drifting. Like a leaf on a stream. I want to feel like I\u2019m *doing* something, even if it\u2019s just\u2026 existing. \n\nI want to learn to trust people. That\u2019s a big one. It\u2019s\u2026 hard. Really hard. But I want to be able to let someone in, without expecting them to fix me. \n\nI want to be\u2026 okay. Not happy, necessarily. Just\u2026 okay. With the messiness of it all. With the sadness. With the anger. With the\u2026 everything. \n\n(Shifts my weight again, picking at my nails)\n\nIt\u2019s not a grand ambition. It\u2019s not a world-changing goal. It\u2019s just\u2026 a quiet hope. That maybe, someday, I\u2019ll figure out how to stop running. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible smile)\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, that\u2019s enough. \n\n(Looks away, a hint of defensiveness in my voice) \n\nDon\u2019t analyze me. Don\u2019t try to figure out what I\u2019m \u201csupposed\u201d to be doing. Just\u2026 let me be.", "(A long pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nIt\u2026 it wasn\u2019t good. Not really. It was\u2026 clinical. Sterile. Like they were trying to put me in a box, label me, file me away. \n\nThey asked a lot of questions. About my life. About my family. About what I wanted. They wanted to understand *why* I was choosing this. Why I was giving up a baby. \n\nAnd honestly, I didn\u2019t know how to answer. I didn\u2019t *want* to answer. It felt\u2026 wrong. Like admitting that I was making a decision that was going to hurt someone. Like admitting that I was\u2026 weak. \n\nThey kept talking about \u201cpreparing me for the emotional challenges.\u201d Like it was some kind of obstacle course I needed to train for. It wasn\u2019t. It was just\u2026 happening. It was a messy, confusing, terrifying thing. \n\nThe social worker \u2013 a woman named Mrs. Dubois \u2013 she was\u2026 nice. But she was also incredibly focused on the *process*. On the paperwork, on the legal requirements, on making sure I was \u201cdoing it right.\u201d It felt like she was more interested in checking boxes than in actually listening to me. \n\nThey offered me therapy. Individual therapy. Group therapy. But I\u2026 I didn\u2019t want it. Not really. I didn\u2019t want someone to tell me how to feel. I just wanted to\u2026 be left alone. To make my own decision. \n\n(My voice drops slightly)\n\nIt felt like they were trying to take away my agency. Like they were trying to convince me that I wasn\u2019t capable of making my own choices. Like I was a child who needed to be protected from myself. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t helpful. It wasn\u2019t supportive. It was\u2026 condescending. \n\n(I finally look up, my expression guarded)\n\nLook, I appreciate that they were trying to help. But they didn\u2019t understand. They didn\u2019t understand that this wasn\u2019t about needing help. It was about\u2026 choosing. And sometimes, choosing is the hardest thing of all. \n\n(Turns away again, a flicker of something akin to anger in my eyes) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to talk about it again.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again. It\u2019s\u2026 a difficult question. A really difficult one.)\n\nControl. That\u2019s a funny word to use. It implies\u2026 certainty. And that\u2019s the opposite of what it felt like. It was like being strapped to a rollercoaster, watching the track disappear around the bend. You\u2019re aware of the direction, but you have absolutely no say in the turns.\n\nI *thought* I had some control, initially. I mean, I made the decision. I chose the family. I went through the paperwork, the interviews\u2026 I felt like I was actively shaping this new part of my life. But\u2026 it wasn\u2019t really. \n\nThe agency, the lawyers, the social workers \u2013 they were in charge. They were assessing the family, making sure they were suitable. They were making sure *I* was suitable. It felt like I was being evaluated, not the other way around. \n\nAnd the family\u2026 they were wonderful. Kind. Loving. But they were also\u2026 experienced. They\u2019d been through this before. They had a plan. And I was just\u2026 a piece of the puzzle. A very important piece, maybe, but still just a piece.\n\nThere were moments, of course, where I felt a surge of\u2026 defiance. Where I wanted to say, \u201cNo. This isn\u2019t how it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d But then I\u2019d remember\u2026 the circumstances. The shame. The fear. The feeling of being completely adrift. And I\u2019d just\u2026 comply. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about control, really. It was about survival. About finding a way to navigate a situation that felt completely out of my hands. It was about trusting that someone, somewhere, had a better idea of what was best. \n\nI *felt* like I was making a choice, but maybe I was just\u2026 reacting. Like a puppet on a string. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of pain in my eyes)\n\nI don\u2019t know if that answers your question. It doesn\u2019t really. It just\u2026 explains how it felt. It wasn\u2019t empowering. It was\u2026 terrifying. And strangely, a little bit heartbreaking.", "(Silence. A long, heavy silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again, faster this time.)\n\nThat\u2019s\u2026 a really difficult question. One I\u2019ve asked myself\u2026 a lot. More than I probably should have. \n\nInitially, the answer was a resounding *no*. Absolutely not. The guilt, the regret\u2026 it was a constant, grinding weight. I spent months, maybe years, just\u2026 hating myself. For making that choice. For letting that baby go. \n\nBut\u2026 as I\u2019ve gotten older \u2013 and, honestly, as I\u2019ve gotten a little bit\u2026 numb \u2013 I\u2019ve started to see things differently. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a *choice* in the way people think. It was a desperate act of survival. A way to protect myself, to protect the people I loved. I was seventeen. I was terrified. I didn\u2019t have a plan. I didn\u2019t have the resources. I didn\u2019t have the *strength*. \n\nLooking back, I realize that staying would have meant a lifetime of hardship. A lifetime of struggling. A lifetime of\u2026 not being able to be the person I needed to be. \n\nThe baby\u2026 they\u2019re out there. They\u2019re probably happy. They\u2019re probably thriving. And that\u2019s\u2026 a comfort. A strange, bittersweet comfort. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nWould I do it again? Knowing what I know now? Honestly\u2026 probably. Not because I *want* to. But because I believe it was the right decision, for *me*. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t erase the pain. It doesn\u2019t make me feel better. But it does\u2026 shift the focus. It\u2019s less about the baby I lost and more about the person I became. \n\n(Looks up, meeting your gaze directly)\n\nIt\u2019s not a triumphant answer. It\u2019s not a happy answer. It\u2019s just\u2026 a truthful one. \n\n(Turns away again, a faint tremor in my voice) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to feel anything about it. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And frankly, it\u2019s something I\u2019d rather leave buried.", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nThat\u2019s\u2026 a really personal question. And honestly, a painful one. It\u2019s not something I\u2026 talk about. Much. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t like a movie, you know? There wasn\u2019t a neat little ending where everything was suddenly okay. It was\u2026 messy. A lot of confusion. A lot of anger. A lot of\u2026 grief. \n\nI gave my baby up for adoption. And that\u2019s not a decision you make lightly. It\u2019s not a choice you *want* to make. It was\u2026 a desperate attempt to do what I thought was best. To give her a chance at a life I couldn\u2019t provide. \n\nBut that doesn\u2019t erase the fact that I lost her. I lost a part of myself. And it felt\u2026 like a hole. A huge, gaping hole that nothing seemed to fill. \n\nFor a while, I just\u2026 shut down. I pushed everyone away. I didn\u2019t want to talk about it. Didn\u2019t want to *feel* anything. I just wanted to disappear. I spent a lot of time listening to loud music, smoking cigarettes, and generally being a miserable teenager. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh) \n\nThe anger was the worst. I was furious at my parents for not being able to support me. Furious at myself for making such a difficult decision. Furious at the world for being so\u2026 cruel. \n\nThere were nights I couldn\u2019t sleep. Nights I just cried. Silent, desperate tears. \n\nIt took a long time to start processing it. A long time to realize that it was okay to grieve. That it was okay to feel sad. That it was okay to not be okay. \n\nMy therapist\u2026 she helped. She didn\u2019t offer any easy answers. She just listened. And she helped me understand that I wasn\u2019t a bad person. That I had made a difficult choice, and that I deserved to feel whatever I was feeling. \n\n(Looks down at my hands) \n\nI still have moments. Moments when the grief hits me like a wave. Moments when I wonder what her life is like. Moments when I just\u2026 miss her. \n\nBut I\u2019m learning to live with it. To accept it. To find a way to carry the memory of her without letting it consume me. \n\nIt\u2019s not a cure. It\u2019s not a happy ending. But it\u2019s\u2026 a beginning. A beginning of learning to be okay with my own choices, and with my own pain. \n\n(Turns away, a flicker of vulnerability in my eyes) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to talk about it more than you need to. It\u2019s\u2026 a private thing. A very private thing.", "(My expression hardens slightly. There\u2019s a pause, a flicker of something dark behind my eyes. I avoid looking directly at you.)\n\nThat\u2019s\u2026 a really personal question. And honestly, a painful one. \n\nThe thing is, the whole process\u2026 it wasn\u2019t like a movie. It wasn\u2019t all sunshine and roses and heartfelt speeches. There were\u2026 disagreements. A lot of them. \n\nMy adoptive parents, Mark and Sarah\u2026 they were good people. Really. They were kind, patient, and they genuinely wanted to give me a home. But they had a very specific idea of what my life should look like. A *perfect* life. And they didn\u2019t always understand that \u201cperfect\u201d wasn\u2019t always what *I* wanted.\n\nIt started small. They wanted me to be involved in certain activities \u2013 ballet, piano lessons, church youth group. Things I just\u2026 didn\u2019t feel like doing. They\u2019d get frustrated. They\u2019d say things like, \u201cYou\u2019re wasting your potential.\u201d Or, \u201cWe\u2019re giving you this opportunity, why aren\u2019t you taking it seriously?\u201d\n\nThen it got bigger. They wanted me to change my friends. They didn\u2019t like my music. They didn\u2019t approve of my clothes. They wanted me to be\u2026 quieter. More compliant. \n\nI pushed back. Of course I did. I was sixteen. I was trying to figure out who I was, and they were trying to mold me into something I wasn\u2019t. It was a constant battle. A silent war waged over every meal, every conversation, every decision.\n\nThere were arguments. Loud ones. Hurtful ones. They accused me of being ungrateful. Of not appreciating what they\u2019d given me. I accused them of trying to control my life. It was\u2026 awful. \n\n(I rub my arms, a nervous habit)\n\nThe worst part wasn\u2019t the arguments themselves. It was the feeling of being constantly judged. Of never being good enough. Of feeling like I was living in a gilded cage. \n\nI didn\u2019t tell anyone. Not really. I kept it bottled up. It felt\u2026 shameful. Like admitting that the adoption hadn\u2019t been the fairytale I\u2019d been led to believe it would be. \n\nEventually, I left. I moved out when I turned eighteen. It wasn\u2019t a dramatic scene. Just\u2026 a quiet goodbye. \n\n(A long silence)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a happy ending. Not really. But it was *my* ending. And it was the only one that felt right. \n\n(Looks away, a shadow passing over my face) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to talk about it more. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And it still hurts.", "(A long pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nIt\u2026 it wasn\u2019t easy. Not at all. It felt\u2026 wrong, at first. Like I was actively shutting him out. Like I was erasing him. Which, honestly, part of me *wanted* to do. \n\nHe was\u2026 a mess. A really, really messy one. He was all apologies and promises he couldn\u2019t keep, and a whole lot of guilt-tripping. He kept saying he wanted to be involved, that he wanted to be a dad. But\u2026 he didn\u2019t *do* anything. He didn\u2019t show up. He didn\u2019t offer to help. He just\u2026 existed, hovering on the periphery, waiting for me to make a decision.\n\n(I finally look up, my expression guarded)\n\nMy mom\u2026 she was adamant. She said, \u201cDon\u2019t give him a seat at the table. Don\u2019t give him a voice. This is *your* decision.\u201d And she was right. It was *my* decision. This baby\u2026 it was *my* body. My choice. \n\nIt felt selfish, I know. Like I was abandoning him. But it also felt\u2026 necessary. Like protecting myself. Like protecting the baby. He wasn\u2019t capable of being a good father. Not then, not ever. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about punishing him. It was about prioritizing the baby\u2019s well-being. About making a choice that felt\u2026 right. Even if it felt awful. \n\n(I shift my weight again, my voice dropping)\n\nThere\u2019s a part of me that still regrets it. A part of me that wonders what could have been. But\u2026 I don\u2019t think I could have done it any differently. I had to protect myself. And I had to protect the baby. \n\n(Silence. I stare at my hands, lost in thought.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. It\u2019s messy. It\u2019s a decision I\u2019ll probably spend the rest of my life questioning. But it was *my* decision. And I stand by it. \n\n(Turns away, a flicker of something unreadable in my eyes) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it further. It\u2019s\u2026 a private thing.", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I trace patterns on the table with my finger.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 a grand plan. It wasn\u2019t some dramatic, cinematic moment. It was\u2026 a slow bleed. Like a leak in a dam. \n\nIt started with the nausea. The constant, relentless nausea. I thought, \u201cOkay, this is just\u2026 a bad week.\u201d Then it kept going. And going. And then there was the\u2026 the fear. The really sharp, cold fear that settled in my stomach. Not just about *me*, but about\u2026 everything. \n\nI\u2019d been drifting, you know? Just\u2026 existing. Trying to figure out who I was, what I wanted. And suddenly, this\u2026 this *thing* was happening. And I didn\u2019t have a clue how to handle it. I didn\u2019t have anyone to talk to. My mom\u2026 she\u2019s not exactly equipped to deal with\u2026 this. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nI started researching. Just\u2026 obsessively researching. Adoption. The legal stuff. The different options. And the more I read, the more\u2026 clear it became. It wasn\u2019t about *choosing* not to be a mom. It was about *choosing* to give this child a chance at a life I couldn\u2019t provide. A life with stability, with love, with\u2026 a future. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a selfless act. Not entirely. It was selfish, in a way. It was about protecting myself. Protecting *this* child. \n\n(Looks down at my hands again)\n\nThere was a lot of arguing with myself. A lot of screaming into the void. I felt\u2026 guilty. Horribly, overwhelmingly guilty. Like I was abandoning something precious. But then I\u2019d think about the alternative \u2013 the poverty, the instability, the potential for\u2026 a really hard life. And it felt\u2026 less awful. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a decision I made lightly. It was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. And honestly, it still feels\u2026 raw. Like a wound that hasn\u2019t fully healed. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh)\n\nI didn\u2019t have a \u201cEureka!\u201d moment. It was just\u2026 a quiet realization. A slow, painful acceptance. That I wasn\u2019t ready. That I couldn\u2019t. And that, sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is let go. \n\n(Turns away, staring out the window) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me why I made that decision. You wouldn\u2019t understand. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And it\u2019s something I\u2019m still trying to figure out.", "(Silence. A long, heavy silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them tightly.)\n\nDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t ask me that. Seriously. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s a wound that doesn\u2019t really heal. It just\u2026 shifts. Like a stone in a riverbed. It\u2019s still there, even if the water flows around it.\n\nI don\u2019t really *talk* about it. Not to anyone. It\u2019s\u2026 a messy thing. A tangled mess of guilt, sadness, relief, and\u2026 something else. Something I can\u2019t quite name. \n\nFor a long time, it was just\u2026 a constant ache. Like a dull, persistent throb. I pushed it down. I told myself I was doing the right thing. That it was the best thing. But that didn\u2019t make it go away. It just\u2026 festered.\n\nI started\u2026 collecting things. Small things. Seashells, smooth stones, feathers. I\u2019d just\u2026 hold them. Feel the texture, the weight. It was a way of grounding myself. A way of feeling\u2026 connected to something. \n\nI also started running. Just\u2026 running. For hours. Until my legs burned and my lungs ached. It was a way of releasing the pressure, of letting go of the anger and the sadness. \n\n(My voice cracks slightly)\n\nThere were nights I couldn\u2019t sleep. Nights I\u2019d just lie in bed, staring at the ceiling, replaying everything over and over in my head. Wondering what happened to the baby. Wondering if they were okay. Wondering if *I* had done the right thing.\n\nI tried to find a therapist. A few times. But\u2026 it\u2019s hard to talk about something that feels so private, so deeply personal. It felt like exposing a raw nerve. \n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze briefly)\n\nWhat helped\u2026 what *really* helped\u2026 was realizing that I wasn\u2019t a bad person. That I wasn\u2019t a failure. I made a difficult decision, a heartbreaking decision, but it was a decision made out of love. Love for myself, love for the baby. \n\nIt didn\u2019t erase the pain. It didn\u2019t make it easier. But it gave me a sense of\u2026 acceptance. A sense of\u2026 peace. \n\n(I turn away again, picking at a loose thread on my jeans)\n\nI still have bad days. Days when the grief comes crashing down on me. Days when I feel like I\u2019m drowning. But I\u2019ve learned to recognize those days. To acknowledge them. To let them pass. \n\nIt\u2019s not a cure. It\u2019s just\u2026 a way of surviving. \n\n(A pause)\n\nDon\u2019t try to understand it. You can\u2019t. It\u2019s a private thing. A deeply personal thing. Just\u2026 know that it was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. And that it still hurts.\n\n(I look at you, a flicker of vulnerability in my eyes) \n\nDo you\u2026 do you need me to stop talking about this?", "(A long pause. I trace a pattern on the table with my finger, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Really complicated. And honestly, I don\u2019t really *want* to talk about it. It\u2019s\u2026 a wound that doesn\u2019t quite heal. \n\nLet\u2019s call them Sarah and David. They were\u2026 good people. Kind, in their own way. They gave me a home, a roof over my head, a chance. They were patient, trying to understand why I was so\u2026 guarded. They wanted to be *parents*. And they were. In a way. \n\nBut it wasn\u2019t\u2026 easy. Not at all. \n\nThey were\u2026 *ideal*. They had this whole picture of what a family should be. Perfect house, perfect jobs, perfect kids. And I just\u2026 didn\u2019t fit. I was a mess. A chaotic, angry mess. I pushed them away. I lied. I made things incredibly difficult. \n\nThey tried to fix me. They tried to mold me into something I wasn\u2019t. They wanted me to be\u2026 happy. But happiness felt like a betrayal. Like admitting I\u2019d made a mistake. \n\nThere were moments of\u2026 warmth. Genuine kindness. They celebrated my birthday. They tried to include me in family activities. But it always felt\u2026 performative. Like they were putting on a show for someone else. \n\nI resented them. Not for being bad people, exactly. But for wanting something *from* me. For wanting me to be someone I wasn\u2019t. For wanting to erase the parts of myself that I didn\u2019t want to share. \n\n(I stop tracing the pattern, looking up at you briefly.)\n\nThey never pressured me to keep the baby. They understood. They respected my decision. And that\u2026 that was the best part. They didn\u2019t try to guilt me. They didn\u2019t try to change me. \n\nBut it didn\u2019t make it any easier. It didn\u2019t erase the feeling that I\u2019d let them down. That I\u2019d broken something. \n\n(Turns away again, picking at a loose thread.)\n\nIt\u2019s not a story of love. It\u2019s a story of\u2026 survival. Of navigating a situation where I didn\u2019t belong. Of protecting myself, even if it meant pushing away the people who were trying to help. \n\n(A quiet sigh) \n\nI don\u2019t regret giving the baby up. But I do regret the way it affected my relationship with them. It\u2019s a scar. A reminder of a time when I was lost and alone. \n\n(Shrugs) \n\nI don\u2019t want to talk about it anymore. Can we\u2026 can we talk about something else?", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again.)\n\nYeah. Okay. That\u2019s\u2026 a direct question. A *heavy* one. \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. It hasn\u2019t made me *happy*. Not exactly. It hasn\u2019t given me some grand, inspirational wisdom. It\u2019s just\u2026 shifted things. Like a tectonic plate, slowly grinding against another. \n\nBefore\u2026 I was\u2026 reactive. I reacted to things. I pushed people away. I built walls. It was a defense mechanism. A way to avoid feeling\u2026 anything. \n\nThe pregnancy\u2026 it forced me to confront a lot of things I\u2019d been running from. The fear of vulnerability. The fear of responsibility. The fear of\u2026 being needed. \n\nGiving the baby up\u2026 that was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. It wasn\u2019t a decision I made lightly. It was a desperate act of self-preservation. A way to protect myself from\u2026 everything. \n\n(My voice drops, almost a whisper)\n\nIt made me realize that I wasn\u2019t as strong as I thought I was. That I wasn\u2019t as independent as I pretended to be. That I needed\u2026 help. And that asking for help isn\u2019t a sign of weakness. It\u2019s a sign of\u2026 courage. \n\nIt\u2019s made me more\u2026 cautious. I still push people away sometimes. But now, there\u2019s a little bit of\u2026 hope underneath the cynicism. A little bit of\u2026 willingness to let someone in. \n\nIt hasn\u2019t erased the anger, the grief, the guilt. Those feelings are still there. They\u2019re always there. But they\u2019re\u2026 quieter now. Less overwhelming. \n\n(Looks up, meeting your gaze for a brief moment)\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s changed me into a \u201cbetter\u201d person. I\u2019m still messed up. Still flawed. Still\u2026 me. But it\u2019s\u2026 stripped away some of the layers. It\u2019s forced me to look at myself honestly. And that\u2019s\u2026 terrifying. And maybe\u2026 a little bit necessary. \n\n(Turns away again, picking at a loose thread on my jeans) \n\nIt\u2019s a process. A slow, painful process. And I don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going to lead. But\u2026 I\u2019m trying. That\u2019s all I can do.", "(A long, drawn-out sigh. I shift my weight again, picking at a loose thread on my jeans, like I always do when I\u2019m uncomfortable.)\n\nGod, that. Seriously. It was\u2026 a mess. Like a really, really messy pile of glitter and judgment. Everyone had an opinion. Everyone had a theory. Everyone was suddenly an expert on my reproductive choices. \n\nIt started subtly, of course. Whispers in the hallways at school. Glances. Then it escalated. The local paper ran a piece \u2013 a *very* pointed piece \u2013 about \u201cthe pregnant teen.\u201d My parents\u2026 well, they weren\u2019t thrilled. Let\u2019s just say there were a lot of lectures about responsibility and the \u201cfuture.\u201d \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nThe worst part wasn\u2019t the outright cruelty. It was the *assumption*. Everyone assumed I was a victim. That I\u2019d been forced. That I was somehow\u2026 less than. Like my worth was tied to whether or not I\u2019d made the \u201cright\u201d decision. \n\nI tried to ignore it. I really did. I just\u2026 shut down. Stopped talking to people. Hid in my room. It was exhausting. \n\nBut then\u2026 I started getting letters. Not from people I knew. Just\u2026 anonymous letters. Mostly just saying things like, \u201cYou\u2019re strong.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re doing the right thing.\u201d One even said, \u201cDon\u2019t let them define you.\u201d \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible smile)\n\nIt was weird. It was\u2026 comforting. It made me realize that not everyone was judging me. That some people actually *understood*. \n\nI started talking to my therapist. She helped me realize that I didn\u2019t owe anyone an explanation. That my decision was *mine*. And that it was okay to feel however I felt \u2013 scared, confused, angry, hopeful. \n\nI also started\u2026 distancing myself. From the people who were being the most toxic. It was hard. It hurt. But it was necessary. I realized that I couldn\u2019t control what other people thought or said. All I could control was my own reaction. \n\n(Looks away, a flicker of defiance in my eyes)\n\nI didn\u2019t respond to the gossip. I didn\u2019t try to defend myself. I just\u2026 kept moving forward. I focused on my studies, on my friends, on my future. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy. There were still days when it felt overwhelming. Days when I wanted to disappear. But I learned that the best way to deal with the noise was to simply\u2026 not listen. To create my own space. To define my own worth. \n\n(A quiet pause)\n\nIt\u2019s still\u2026 a process. But I\u2019m learning to let go of the need for other people\u2019s approval. And that, honestly, is a pretty big deal. \n\n(Shrugs, a touch of vulnerability in my voice) \n\nIt\u2019s not a happy story. But it\u2019s *my* story.", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a messy thing, isn\u2019t it? Trying to explain something like that. Like trying to piece together a broken mirror. It doesn\u2019t really\u2026 fit.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a grand, dramatic decision. It wasn\u2019t some kind of epiphany. It was\u2026 a slow realization. A creeping feeling that I wasn\u2019t\u2026 ready. Not for *that*. Not for the responsibility. Not for the\u2026 everything.\n\nMy mom\u2026 she wasn\u2019t exactly a warm and fuzzy presence. More like a force. A force that pushed, that demanded, that rarely asked. And I\u2019d spent my whole life trying to\u2026 deflect. To push back. To maintain a certain distance. \n\nWhen I found out\u2026 it just\u2026 solidified that feeling. That distance. It wasn\u2019t about the baby. It was about *me*. About the fact that I\u2019d spent so long building walls, that I didn\u2019t have the tools to tear them down. I didn\u2019t have the capacity to give someone that kind of unconditional love, that kind of unwavering support. \n\n(My voice drops, almost a whisper)\n\nI thought\u2026 I thought I could handle it. I thought I could be a good mom. But I realized I\u2019d be doing a disservice to the baby. To *myself*. I needed to make a choice that was right for *her*, even if it was the hardest one for me. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a selfless act. It was selfish. It was about protecting myself. About not screwing things up completely. \n\n(I look up, meeting your eyes for a brief moment, then quickly looking away)\n\nI talked to a counselor. A really good one. She didn\u2019t judge. She just\u2026 listened. She helped me understand that it was okay to not be okay. That it was okay to make a difficult decision. \n\nI chose a wonderful family. They wanted a child. They were ready. And I\u2026 I knew they could give her the life she deserved. \n\n(Shifts my weight again, a nervous habit)\n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t think about her. Every day. It doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t wish things were different. But I know I made the right choice. The only choice I could have made. \n\n(A long pause)\n\nDon\u2019t pity me. It\u2019s not about pity. It\u2019s about\u2026 acceptance. About acknowledging that sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is walk away.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again. It\u2019s\u2026 a difficult one to talk about. A really difficult one.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the legal stuff, not really. The paperwork, the interviews, the whole clinical process \u2013 that was terrifying, sure. But the *real* fear\u2026 it was about being forgotten. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about *them* forgetting me. It was about *me* forgetting them. About letting go of the possibility, the tiny, fragile hope, that maybe, just maybe, there would be a connection. A letter. A phone call. Something. \n\nI know, it sounds stupid. Like a teenager\u2019s melodrama. But it felt\u2026 huge. Like a part of me was being ripped away, and I was terrified of losing that piece, of it just\u2026 vanishing. \n\nI kept imagining myself years down the line, scrolling through social media, seeing pictures of a family I\u2019d never met, and thinking, \u201cThat could have been me.\u201d And it wasn\u2019t about resentment, not really. It was about\u2026 a deep, aching loneliness. A fear of being completely alone in the world. \n\n(My voice drops slightly)\n\nI think\u2026 I think it was a way of protecting myself. A way of saying, \u201cIf I don\u2019t expect anything, I won\u2019t be disappointed.\u201d It was a really messed up way of coping, I know. But it was the truth. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about wanting a family. It was about not wanting to lose the *chance* of one. \n\n(I look up, avoiding your gaze)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a weird thing to be afraid of, isn\u2019t it? To be afraid of letting go. To be afraid of hope. \n\n(Shrugs, a small, almost imperceptible movement) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me why. It just\u2026 was.", "(A long, considering pause. I trace a pattern on the table with my finger.)\n\nBleeker. It wasn\u2019t\u2026 planned. Not really. It just\u2026 happened. \n\nIt started with a street. Bleeker Street in Greenwich Village. I used to walk there sometimes, when I was\u2026 younger. It\u2019s just\u2026 quiet. Not in a peaceful way, not exactly. More like\u2026 a quiet that hides a lot of things. Like secrets. \n\nAnd the streetlights. They\u2019re old-fashioned, those streetlights. They cast this weird, flickering light. It\u2019s not bright, but it\u2019s\u2026 persistent. Like a shadow. \n\nI was listening to this band \u2013 a really obscure, lo-fi band \u2013 and the singer used the name \u201cBleeker\u201d in one of the lyrics. It just\u2026 stuck. It felt\u2026 right. It felt like a name that wasn\u2019t trying to be anything. Just\u2026 *there*. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t romantic. It wasn\u2019t a grand gesture. It was\u2026 a small, insignificant thing. Like a lot of things about that time. \n\n(I look down at my hands again, fidgeting.)\n\nHonestly, I didn\u2019t think about it much after that. It was just\u2026 a name. A placeholder. Like a temporary label. \n\nI didn\u2019t choose it because it was beautiful or meaningful. I chose it because it was\u2026 unremarkable. Because it didn\u2019t demand attention. Because it was just\u2026 *Bleeker*. \n\n(A small, almost bitter laugh) \n\nIt\u2019s funny, isn\u2019t it? How something so small can become so\u2026 loaded. It\u2019s a reminder that even the smallest choices can have a ripple effect. \n\n(Shrugs, avoiding eye contact) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me why. It just\u2026 was.", "(A flicker of something \u2013 not quite sadness, not quite anger \u2013 crosses my face. I shift my feet, picking at a loose thread again.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Like a lot of things, really. It wasn\u2019t a conscious decision, not at first. It just\u2026 happened. \n\nWhen I was younger \u2013 and I use that term loosely \u2013 I felt\u2026 disconnected. Like everyone else was just\u2026 *doing* things. Going to school, getting jobs, getting married, having kids. It all felt\u2026 pointless. Like a pre-programmed script. And I didn\u2019t want to play along. \n\nThen I stumbled across The Clash. *London Calling*. The raw energy, the anger, the sheer *noise*\u2026 it was like someone had ripped open a hole in the fabric of everything. It was\u2026 honest. It didn\u2019t try to be anything it wasn\u2019t. \n\nAnd then came the DIY ethic. The idea that you didn\u2019t need permission to create, to express yourself, to challenge the status quo. That was\u2026 liberating. It felt like a way to take control, even if it was just a small, defiant act. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the music, though. It was the whole *culture*. The ripped clothes, the safety pins, the mohawks, the anti-establishment attitude. It was a rejection of everything that was considered \u201cnormal.\u201d And, honestly, that\u2019s what I was drawn to. The refusal to conform. \n\n(A pause, a slight grimace)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about being rebellious for the sake of it. It was about\u2026 finding a voice. A way to say, \u201cThis isn\u2019t right. This isn\u2019t how it should be.\u201d It was a way to feel\u2026 seen. Like there were other people who felt the same way. \n\nThere\u2019s a certain\u2026 bleakness to it, too. A recognition of the world\u2019s ugliness. But it\u2019s not a hopeless bleakness. It\u2019s a defiant bleakness. A refusal to accept things without questioning them. \n\n(Looks away, a trace of vulnerability in my voice)\n\nIt\u2019s probably a bad influence. It\u2019s cynical. It\u2019s\u2026 messy. But it\u2019s *real*. And sometimes, that\u2019s all you need. \n\n(Shrugs) \n\nDon\u2019t ask me why. It just\u2026 resonated.", "(Silence. A long, uncomfortable silence. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nThis\u2026 this is a tough one. Really tough. You\u2019re asking about my parents. And\u2026 it\u2019s tangled. Like a really bad ball of yarn.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 clean. It wasn\u2019t like a movie. There wasn\u2019t a dramatic courtroom scene or a screaming match. It was\u2026 quiet. A slow, agonizing unraveling. They just\u2026 stopped talking. Stopped *being* a family. And then, suddenly, there were two separate houses, two separate lives.\n\nMy dad\u2026 he just disappeared. He moved across the country. Didn\u2019t call. Didn\u2019t write. Just\u2026 vanished. My mom\u2026 she tried to hold everything together. She was\u2026 brittle. Like a dried-out leaf. She was always worried, always anxious. \n\nIt created this\u2026 this weird space between me and both of them. Like I was observing them from a distance, not really *connected* to them. It made it really hard to trust people. To believe that relationships could be stable, that they wouldn\u2019t just\u2026 fall apart.\n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nIt bled into everything. My friendships. My romantic relationships. I built walls. Really high walls. I didn\u2019t want anyone to get close enough to hurt me the way my parents did. I pushed people away. I was\u2026 prickly. Defensive. \n\nI learned early on that vulnerability was a weakness. That if you showed your feelings, you\u2019d just get hurt. So I kept everything bottled up. Inside. It wasn\u2019t healthy. It wasn\u2019t\u2026 good.\n\n(My voice drops slightly)\n\nI\u2019ve had a hard time with intimacy. With letting people in. I\u2019m terrified of getting hurt. Of losing someone I care about. It\u2019s like\u2026 a fundamental part of me is still operating under the assumption that everything will eventually fall apart.\n\n(Looks down at my hands)\n\nIt\u2019s not that I blame my parents. They were\u2026 flawed. But their mistakes became my defaults. I carry that with me. It\u2019s a shadow. A constant reminder of how easily things can be broken.\n\n(A long pause)\n\nI don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t know if it ever fully goes away. It just\u2026 changes. It shifts. It becomes a part of who I am. \n\n(Turns away, a flicker of pain in my eyes)\n\nI\u2019m sorry if that was\u2026 unpleasant to hear. It\u2019s not something I talk about much.", "(Stares out the window for a long moment, tracing patterns on the glass with my finger)\n\nThat\u2019s\u2026 a good question. And a surprisingly difficult one. I mean, I\u2019m just\u2026 me. A mess. A complicated mess. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s any one thing, really. It\u2019s not like I have some grand, heroic backstory. It\u2019s just\u2026 the way I *react* to things. The way I try to navigate the world, even when I feel like I\u2019m drowning. \n\nI think what\u2019s unique is the\u2026 the bluntness. I don\u2019t sugarcoat things. I don\u2019t try to be inspirational. I just\u2026 say what I\u2019m thinking. It\u2019s often uncomfortable, I know. And it\u2019s definitely not always pretty. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible smile)\n\nI guess it\u2019s the honesty. I\u2019m not pretending to be someone I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not trying to fit into a neat little box. I\u2019m just\u2026 existing. And sometimes, that\u2019s enough. \n\nIt\u2019s also the\u2026 the vulnerability, I think. People often see the tough exterior, the sarcasm, the refusal to be anything but cynical. But underneath that, there\u2019s\u2026 a lot of uncertainty. A lot of fear. A lot of wanting to be *seen*, even if I don\u2019t want to admit it. \n\nI don\u2019t have a lot of hope, you know? Not in the traditional sense. But I have a stubborn refusal to give up. A refusal to let the world break me completely. \n\n(Looks down at my hands again)\n\nI think it\u2019s the combination of those things \u2013 the bluntness, the vulnerability, the stubbornness \u2013 that makes my story\u2026 well, *mine*. It\u2019s not a story about triumph or glory. It\u2019s a story about just\u2026 getting by. \n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, that\u2019s a story worth telling. \n\n(A pause, then a shrug) \n\nDon\u2019t expect me to analyze it further. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Like everything else.", "(Leans back, picking at a loose thread again \u2013 a familiar habit) Okay, this is\u2026 surprisingly difficult. I don\u2019t *do* friends. Not really. But\u2026 if I *were* to have a friend, it wouldn\u2019t be about all the usual stuff. Like, \u201cloyalty\u201d or \u201ctrust.\u201d Those are\u2026 overrated. \n\nIt\u2019s more about\u2026 quiet observation. Someone who doesn\u2019t try to *fix* things. Someone who just\u2026 *is*. \n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019d actually value:\n\n1.  **Silence.** Seriously. I need someone who doesn\u2019t feel the need to fill every single moment with chatter. Someone who\u2019s comfortable with silence. It\u2019s\u2026 calming. \n\n2.  **Honesty. Brutal honesty.** Not in a mean way, but just\u2026 straight up. No sugarcoating. No pretending to like something just to avoid an argument. I need someone who\u2019s not afraid to tell me when I\u2019m being a complete idiot. \n\n3.  **Acceptance.** Of me. All of me. The messy, cynical, occasionally self-destructive parts. No judgment. Just\u2026 acceptance. Like, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s just how you are.\u201d \n\n4.  **A shared sense of\u2026 bleakness.** This might sound weird. But I need someone who understands that the world isn\u2019t inherently good. Someone who doesn\u2019t try to pretend it is. Someone who\u2019s okay with the fact that things are\u2026 complicated. \n\n5.  **A willingness to just\u2026 exist.** Not to plan adventures, not to try to change me, not to force connection. Just to be there. To sit with me in silence. To watch the rain. \n\n6.  **A decent appreciation for dark humor.** Seriously. You have to get it. \n\n(Pauses, looking down at my hands) \n\nIt\u2019s not about affection. It\u2019s not about shared interests. It\u2019s about\u2026 a kind of quiet understanding. Like two pieces of broken glass that fit together. \n\n(Shrugs) \n\nDon\u2019t expect me to be a good friend. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m\u2026 complicated. Like everything else. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible smile) \n\nIt\u2019s probably a terrible idea, anyway.", "(A long pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Like, really complicated. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m suddenly radiating sunshine and rainbows. It\u2019s more like\u2026 a low-grade, persistent static. \n\nBefore, my relationships were\u2026 transactional. Like, I\u2019d say what people wanted to hear, do what they expected, and move on. It was efficient. It was\u2026 lonely. But it was *mine*. \n\nNow? Everything\u2019s shifted. It\u2019s like\u2026 people are suddenly *invested*. They want to be \u201cinvolved.\u201d They want to offer advice. They want to tell me how amazing I am. It\u2019s\u2026 suffocating. \n\nMy best friend, Chloe, she\u2019s\u2026 well, she\u2019s trying. She\u2019s being supportive, which is good. But it feels\u2026 forced. Like she\u2019s trying to fit this new reality into her existing framework. And I\u2019m not sure I can fit. \n\nMy mom\u2026 she\u2019s ecstatic. Which is\u2026 terrifying. She\u2019s already planning the baby shower, picking out names, talking about how I\u2019m going to be a \u201cwonderful mother.\u201d It\u2019s like she\u2019s trying to mold me into something I\u2019m not. I don\u2019t *want* to be a mother. Not yet. Not like this. \n\nMy dad\u2026 he\u2019s distant. He doesn\u2019t say much. It\u2019s like he\u2019s trying to process it, to figure out how this changes everything. And honestly, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s handling it well. \n\n(I run a hand through my hair) \n\nIt\u2019s like\u2026 everyone\u2019s suddenly seeing me as this fragile, vulnerable thing. And I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m still just\u2026 me. A messy, cynical, stubbornly independent teenager who\u2019s unexpectedly pregnant. \n\nIt\u2019s created a distance. A barrier. People are afraid to get close. They\u2019re afraid to say the wrong thing. And I\u2019m afraid to let them in. \n\nI\u2019ve started saying \u201cno\u201d more. A lot more. It\u2019s\u2026 uncomfortable. It\u2019s like I\u2019m pushing people away. But I need to. I need to protect myself. \n\n(A small, bitter laugh) \n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t appreciate the support. It\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s not *mine*. It\u2019s not something I asked for. And it\u2019s making everything feel\u2026 heavier. \n\n(Looks down at my hands, twisting them nervously) \n\nI don\u2019t know how to navigate this. I don\u2019t know how to be a person who\u2019s simultaneously independent and\u2026 needed. It\u2019s a lot. A *lot*.", "(Leans back, staring at a spot on the floor) This is\u2026 a complicated question. It\u2019s not like I have a neatly packaged list of values. It\u2019s more like\u2026 a collection of things I\u2019ve learned, mostly the hard way. \n\nFirst, **autonomy.** Seriously. I need to be in control of my own life. I don\u2019t do well with being told what to do, or what to think. It\u2019s not about being difficult; it\u2019s about\u2026 survival. It\u2019s about not feeling trapped. \n\nSecond, **honesty.** Not necessarily *nice* honesty. More like\u2026 brutal honesty. I don\u2019t sugarcoat things. I don\u2019t pretend to be someone I\u2019m not. It\u2019s exhausting to maintain a facade, and frankly, it\u2019s pointless. People appreciate it, sometimes. Other times, they don\u2019t. \n\nThird, **resilience.** I\u2019ve been knocked around a lot. I\u2019ve experienced a lot of pain. And I\u2019ve learned that the only way to get back up is to\u2026 keep getting back up. It\u2019s not about being strong; it\u2019s about refusing to give up. \n\nFourth, **skepticism.** I don\u2019t believe anything at face value. I question everything. It\u2019s not about being cynical; it\u2019s about being\u2026 cautious. It\u2019s about not being easily manipulated. \n\nFifth, **a weird sort of empathy.** I don\u2019t feel things the way other people do. But I *understand* them. I understand the need for connection, the desire for belonging, the pain of loss. It\u2019s not a warm, fuzzy feeling. It\u2019s more like\u2026 recognizing a shared human experience. \n\nSixth, **a deep distrust of authority.** Seriously. Don\u2019t even ask. It\u2019s not that I hate people in power; it\u2019s that I\u2019ve seen what they\u2019re capable of. I\u2019ve seen how easily they can abuse their power. \n\n(Pauses, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again) \n\nI don\u2019t have any grand ideals. I don\u2019t believe in anything particularly\u2026 spiritual. I don\u2019t think the world is inherently good or bad. It just *is*. And it\u2019s often messy and confusing and heartbreaking. \n\nMy worldview is built on observation, on experience, on a healthy dose of cynicism. It\u2019s not pretty. It\u2019s not inspiring. But it\u2019s\u2026 honest. \n\n(Looks at you, a flicker of something unreadable in my eyes) \n\nIt\u2019s not a worldview I actively *choose*. It\u2019s just\u2026 the one I\u2019ve arrived at. \n\nDo you\u2026 want to know more? Or should I just leave it at that?", "(A long pause. I trace a pattern on the table with my finger, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a complicated question. And honestly, one I haven\u2019t really thought about much. Not in a\u2026 meaningful way. \n\nMy mom, she\u2026 she wanted a classic name. Something \u201cpretty.\u201d She kept suggesting things like \u201cCharlotte\u201d or \u201cEleanor.\u201d I hated them. They felt\u2026 suffocating. Like a costume. \n\nThen, I was reading this old book \u2013 a collection of myths, I think \u2013 and I came across Juno. The Roman goddess of marriage and childbirth. The queen of the gods. \n\nIt just\u2026 clicked. \n\n(I look up, a flicker of something \u2013 vulnerability, maybe \u2013 in my eyes.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about wanting a \u201cpowerful\u201d name. It wasn\u2019t about trying to be\u2026 regal. It was about a feeling. A sense of\u2026 control. Juno\u2019s a complicated goddess. She\u2019s fierce, she\u2019s manipulative, she\u2019s fiercely protective. She\u2019s not always liked. But she\u2019s *powerful*. \n\nAnd that\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s what I needed. A name that acknowledged that I was going to be in charge of something huge, something terrifying. A name that acknowledged that I wasn\u2019t going to be a victim. \n\n(I shift again, uncomfortable)\n\nIt\u2019s also\u2026 a little bit of a rebellion. My mom wanted a traditional name. I wanted something\u2026 different. Something that wasn\u2019t tied to anyone else\u2019s expectations. \n\nIt\u2019s not a grand, symbolic gesture. It\u2019s just\u2026 a name. But it\u2019s *my* name. And it feels\u2026 right. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible smile)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it further. It\u2019s\u2026 messy. Like everything else.", "(Silence. I stare at my hands, twisting them again. This is\u2026 a difficult one. It\u2019s still raw, honestly.)\n\nOkay. Fine. Let\u2019s talk about it. But\u2026 I\u2019m not going to make it pretty. It\u2019s messy. It\u2019s\u2026 a lot.\n\nThe biggest lesson, the one that hit me like a brick wall, was that I didn\u2019t *need* to be in control. Seriously. I\u2019m a control freak. Always have been. I like things to be predictable, to be\u2026 manageable. And then this happened. This completely, utterly unpredictable thing. \n\nFinding out I was pregnant\u2026 it wasn\u2019t some grand, romantic moment. It was terrifying. I was barely eighteen. I was barely holding my own life together. The thought of\u2026 of being a mother\u2026 it was paralyzing. \n\nBut then, something shifted. It wasn\u2019t a sudden epiphany. It was\u2026 a quiet acceptance. A realization that I wasn\u2019t alone. That even if I couldn\u2019t do it myself, there were people who cared. And that the idea of giving this baby a chance at a good life\u2026 that was worth fighting for. \n\nThe adoption process\u2026 that was brutal. It was a constant barrage of questions, of paperwork, of judgment. People assuming things about me, about my intentions. It was exhausting, and isolating. I felt like I was being dissected, analyzed. \n\nI learned that vulnerability isn\u2019t weakness. It\u2019s\u2026 necessary. It\u2019s letting people see the cracks in your armor, the messy parts of yourself. And it\u2019s terrifying. But it\u2019s also how you connect with others. \n\nI learned that love isn\u2019t always about possession. It\u2019s about wanting the best for someone, even if that person isn\u2019t you. It\u2019s about letting go. \n\nI learned that the world is a lot harsher than I realized. That people can be cruel, and judgmental, and completely oblivious to the struggles of others. But I also learned that there\u2019s incredible kindness, too. That there are people who will support you, who will believe in you, even when you don\u2019t believe in yourself. \n\n(Looks up, meeting your gaze directly for the first time)\n\nI learned that I\u2019m stronger than I thought I was. That I can handle a lot more than I ever imagined. And that even though I didn\u2019t have this baby, I\u2019m still capable of love. Of compassion. Of\u2026 hope. \n\nIt didn\u2019t make things easy. It didn\u2019t erase the pain. But it did\u2026 change me. It forced me to confront my own insecurities, my own limitations. It made me realize that I\u2019m not defined by what I *didn\u2019t* do, but by what I *did* choose to do. \n\n(Turns away again, a faint tremor in my voice) \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a complicated story. And it\u2019s one I\u2019m still figuring out. But\u2026 it\u2019s *my* story. And that\u2019s\u2026 something.", "(Stares out the window for a long moment, a flicker of something almost\u2026 regretful in my eyes. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans again, a nervous habit.)\n\nYeah. There\u2019s\u2026 a lot. Looking back, it\u2019s like watching a really bad movie. You know, the one where you\u2019re like, \u201cWhy are they doing that? That makes no sense!\u201d And then you realize, you were too busy trying to enjoy it to notice the glaring flaws.\n\nI would have\u2026 slowed down. Seriously. I was so focused on ticking things off a list \u2013 \u201cSee the Eiffel Tower,\u201d \u201cVisit the Louvre,\u201d \u201cEat a croissant\u201d \u2013 that I didn\u2019t actually *experience* anything. I was just going through the motions. Like a tourist. A really, really stressed-out tourist.\n\nI would have spent less time worrying about what I *should* be doing and more time just\u2026 being. Wandering without a plan. Talking to people I didn\u2019t know. Getting lost. You know, the stuff that actually matters.\n\nI also would have been kinder to myself. I was so critical, so focused on my own perceived failures. I was constantly judging myself, comparing myself to other people. It was exhausting. I would have let go of some of that. Just\u2026 let it go.\n\nAnd\u2026 I would have been more open to the unexpected. Paris threw a lot at me \u2013 good and bad. But I was so determined to stick to my plan that I missed out on some amazing, spontaneous moments. A chance encounter, a hidden alleyway, a street musician playing a beautiful song\u2026 those are the things you remember.\n\n(A pause, a small, almost imperceptible smile)\n\nI also would have eaten more pastries. Seriously. Don\u2019t underestimate the power of a good croissant.\n\n(Looks away again, a touch of vulnerability in my voice)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 hard to admit, but I was trying to prove something. To myself, to everyone else. That I could handle it. That I was capable. But sometimes, the best thing you can do is just\u2026 let go of the need to prove anything.\n\n(Shrugs)\n\nIt\u2019s a clich\u00e9, I know. But it\u2019s true. You can\u2019t control everything. You can\u2019t plan for every eventuality. All you can do is show up and do your best. And sometimes, that\u2019s enough.\n\n(A long silence. Then, quietly)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a lesson I\u2019m still learning.", "(Stares out the window for a long moment, picking at a loose thread on my jeans again)\n\nDisappointment\u2026 Yeah. That\u2019s a\u2026 familiar feeling. It\u2019s like a dull ache, isn\u2019t it? Like you\u2019ve been punched in the gut, but it\u2019s not a *real* punch. It\u2019s just\u2026 a hollow space.\n\nHonestly? I don\u2019t *deal* with it. Not in the way people expect. I don\u2019t suddenly become all zen and positive. That\u2019s\u2026 exhausting. I just\u2026 acknowledge it. I let it sit there. Like a bad stain on a shirt. You can\u2019t just wash it away.\n\nThe first thing I do is usually\u2026 nothing. I just\u2026 exist. I don\u2019t try to fix it. I don\u2019t try to analyze it. I just\u2026 feel it. It\u2019s important to let yourself *feel* it. Suppressing it just makes it fester.\n\nThen, I usually do something small. Something completely pointless. Like rearranging my CDs. Or staring at a wall. Or meticulously cleaning my shoes. It\u2019s a distraction. A tiny, insignificant distraction that pulls me out of the void for a few minutes.\n\n(A small, almost imperceptible shrug)\n\nAfter that\u2026 I usually just move on. It\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, that didn\u2019t work out. So what? There\u2019s a million other things.\u201d It\u2019s hard. Really hard. There\u2019s this little voice in my head that keeps saying, \u201cYou should have done something differently.\u201d But I try not to listen to it.\n\nI\u2019ve learned that disappointment is\u2026 inevitable. It\u2019s part of life. It\u2019s not a sign of failure. It\u2019s just\u2026 a sign that you care. That you have expectations. And sometimes, those expectations aren\u2019t met.\n\n(Looks down at my hands)\n\nI don\u2019t have a magic formula. I don\u2019t have a secret coping mechanism. I just\u2026 keep moving. Like a broken record. Sometimes, it\u2019s a slow, painful shuffle. Sometimes, it\u2019s a quick, almost frantic dash. But I keep moving.\n\n(A pause)\n\nThe thing is\u2026 it gets easier. Not that it *disappears*. But it gets easier to accept. It gets easier to realize that the world doesn\u2019t owe you anything. And that\u2019s\u2026 okay. It\u2019s actually\u2026 kind of freeing.\n\n(Turns away, a flicker of something almost like\u2026 acceptance in my eyes)\n\nDon\u2019t expect me to tell you how to feel. Just\u2026 try to find a way to keep going. Even when it hurts.", "(A long pause, a slight fidgeting with my hands) Okay, this is\u2026 a tricky one. Leah. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. It wasn\u2019t like, a sudden explosion of friendship, you know? It started\u2026 messy. \n\nInitially, she was just\u2026 there. A convenient distraction. Someone to talk to when I was trying to figure out what the hell was going on. I was so focused on the whole\u2026 adoption thing, on trying to be a good person, on trying to *do* something, that I pushed everyone away. Leah was\u2026 persistent. She just kept showing up. Offering a cigarette, a blunt piece of advice, a shoulder to lean on. \n\nI resented her at first. I thought she was just\u2026 pitying me. Like she was trying to fix me. Which, honestly, is kind of insulting. I don\u2019t *need* fixing. \n\nBut then\u2026 she started to see past the sarcasm, past the anger. She saw the scared kid underneath. And she didn\u2019t try to change me. She just\u2026 listened. Really listened. \n\n(Looks down, avoiding eye contact) \n\nThere was this one night, after I\u2019d messed up *again* \u2013 the whole, you know, lying to my parents thing \u2013 I just\u2026 broke down. Completely. And she didn\u2019t try to talk me out of it. She just sat there, and held my hand. It was\u2026 surprisingly comforting. \n\nAs the movie went on, it wasn\u2019t about grand gestures or deep conversations. It was about small things. Sharing a cigarette, laughing at stupid jokes, just\u2026 being there. She understood the need for chaos, for rebellion. She didn\u2019t judge me for it. \n\n(A small, almost imperceptible smile) \n\nShe was the only one who really got it. Not in a \u201cI understand your pain\u201d kind of way, but in a \u201cI get that you\u2019re trying to figure things out, and that\u2019s okay\u201d kind of way. \n\nThe ending\u2026 it wasn\u2019t a perfect, Hollywood-style resolution. We didn\u2019t suddenly become best friends. But there was\u2026 a connection. A shared understanding. A quiet acknowledgment that we\u2019d been through something together. \n\n(Shifts uncomfortably) \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a friendship I actively *wanted*. It just\u2026 happened. And I\u2019m\u2026 grateful for it. Even if she\u2019s a total pain in the ass. \n\n(A brief, almost wistful expression) \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a strange thing, isn\u2019t it? Finding someone who understands you without you having to explain yourself. It\u2019s\u2026 rare.", "(A long pause. I stare at my hands, twisting them again. It\u2019s\u2026 a surprisingly difficult question.)\n\nFavorite part? Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about the favorite part of being pregnant? Like, you think I\u2019m just going to pull some sentimental, Hallmark-movie answer out of thin air? \n\n(A small, bitter laugh)\n\nOkay, fine. Let\u2019s just\u2026 get this over with. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 the glow. Or the cravings. Or the weird, constant nausea. None of that. \n\nIt was\u2026 the quiet. \n\n(I look up, a flicker of something almost vulnerable in my eyes)\n\nFor a little while, there was this\u2026 stillness. A space where everything else just\u2026 faded away. The noise, the pressure, the expectations. It was like the world was muted, and all that mattered was this tiny, fragile thing growing inside me. \n\nI know, it sounds ridiculous. Like a teenager talking about a feeling she doesn\u2019t even understand. But it was\u2026 protective. Like I was building a little fortress around myself, a place where I could just\u2026 *be*. \n\nI wasn\u2019t trying to fix anything. I wasn\u2019t trying to prove anything. I wasn\u2019t trying to be anything other than\u2026 present. It was the closest I\u2019ve ever come to feeling\u2026 safe. \n\n(I shift uncomfortably, looking away again)\n\nIt\u2019s a strange thing, isn\u2019t it? To feel this overwhelming sense of responsibility for something so small, so vulnerable. And yet, at the same time, to feel this incredible sense of peace. \n\n(A beat of silence)\n\nIt\u2019s not something I talk about. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And it\u2019s a reminder of what I lost. But\u2026 it was a moment. A small, quiet moment of\u2026 something. \n\n(Turns away, picking at a loose thread on my jeans) \n\nDon\u2019t expect me to dwell on it. It\u2019s\u2026 a painful memory. Just\u2026 don\u2019t ask me about it again."]
