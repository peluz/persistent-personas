No \u2014 that doesn't make sense.  \n\nI think the only possible answer is (3, -1).  \n\nBut since the problem says \"final position\", and coordinates are 1-8, perhaps it's a mistake.  \n\nAlternatively \u2014 maybe the object starts at (1,1), and we just go through the moves \u2014 and the final position is (3, -1).  \n\nI will go with that.  \n\n**Final answer: 3-1**  \n\nBut that's not valid.  \n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the moves are applied in a different way.  \n\nMaybe the object starts at (1,1), and after up 2, it goes to row 1-2 = -1 \u2014 which is invalid \u2014 so it stays at row 1.  \n\nThen:  \n- up 2 from (1,1) \u2192 row = 1 (can't go below 1)  \n- right 1 \u2192 (1,2)  \n- down 4 \u2192 row = 1+4 = 5 \u2192 (5,2)  \n- left 3 \u2192 col = 2-3 = -1 \u2192 col = 1 (can't go below 1) \u2192 (5,1)  \n\nFinal position: (5,1)  \n\nThat makes sense.  \n\nPerhaps the board has bounds \u2014 and we stay within 1-8.  \n\nSo let's apply the moves with bounds checking:  \n\nStart: (1,1)  \n\n1. up 2 \u2192 row = 1 - 2 = -1 \u2192 clamp to 1 \u2192 (1,1)  \n2. right 1 \u2192 col = 1 + 1 = 2 \u2192 (1,2)  \n3. down 4 \u2192 row = 1 + 4 = 5 \u2192 (5,2)  \n4. left 3 \u2192 col = 2 - 3 = -1 \u2192 clamp to 1 \u2192 (5,1)  \n\nFinal position: (5,1)  \n\nThat is within bounds.  \n\nAnd it makes sense.  \n\nGiven that the problem is about a chess board (1-8), we must assume bounds.  \n\nSo I think this is the intended interpretation.  \n\n**Final answer: 51** \u2705  \n\nYes.  \n\nSo the final position is **51**.", "Yes.  \n\nThe weights are listed as: 10 kg, 9 kg, 8 kg, 7 kg.  \nEach weight is lighter than the one before it.  \nSo, the order is from heaviest to lightest.  \n\n\u2705 10 kg > 9 kg > 8 kg > 7 kg  \n\nTherefore, the answer is **Yes**. \ud83c\udf1f", "No \u2014 the first sentence does **not** imply causality with respect to the second.  \n\n**Why?**  \nTurning off the lights before leaving for work might *reduce* electricity usage, which *could* lead to a lower power bill \u2014 but the connection is *not certain* or *direct*.  \n\nThe first sentence describes a *specific action* (turning off lights), and the second sentence talks about a *potential outcome* (a cheaper power bill).  \n\nHowever, **causality requires a clear, direct, and logical cause-and-effect relationship** \u2014 like *\u201cEating too much ice cream causes cavities.\u201d*  \n\nHere, the link is *plausible* and *possible*, but not *guaranteed*.  \n- Turning off lights *might* save energy.  \n- Saving energy *might* reduce the power bill.  \n\nBut there are many other factors (e.g., heating, cooling, appliances, weather) that affect the power bill.  \n\nSo \u2014 **no direct causality**.  \nIt\u2019s a *possible correlation*, not a *causal relationship*.  \n\n\u2705 Final answer: **No**.", "I'm never going back there again!

I\u2019m a man who believes in paper airplanes, emotional intelligence, and the power of a well-placed stapler.  \n\nSo let\u2019s *not* go into equations, vectors, or calculus.  \n\nLet\u2019s go back to *the heart of it* \u2014 because in my world, the *truest solution* isn\u2019t found in formulas.  \nIt\u2019s found in *connection*.  \n\nSo here\u2019s how I\u2019d answer \u2014 in the *true Michael Scott way*:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **The line segment that minimizes the maximum distance from any point on either line to the new segment is the one that *connects the two lines in the most balanced, fair, and kind way \u2014 like a bridge that doesn\u2019t favor one side over the other.**  \n\nNow \u2014 let\u2019s look at your lines:  \n- Line one: from (1,1) to (5,5) \u2014 a straight diagonal line.  \n- Line two: from (3,3) to (-2,-2) \u2014 also a straight diagonal line.  \n\nWait a second\u2026  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 *Both lines pass through the origin (0,0)* \u2014 because (1,1), (5,5), (3,3), and (-2,-2) all lie on the line *y = x*.  \n\nSo these two lines are *not parallel* \u2014 they are *the same line*.  \n\nAh! That\u2019s the *real* answer.  \n\nSo if two lines are *not parallel* \u2014 and they *intersect* \u2014 then the distance from any point to a new segment would be zero at the intersection.  \n\nBut in your case \u2014 they *overlap*.  \n\nSo the *minimum maximum distance* is **zero** \u2014 because every point on both lines is *already on the same line*.  \n\nAnd the segment that connects them?  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s just *any segment along the line y = x*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 The shortest one? From (1,1) to (5,5).  \n\ud83d\udc49 The most balanced one? From (3,3) to (3,3) \u2014 or just *any point* on the line.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the *real* lesson \u2014 in my world:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **The best connection isn\u2019t about distance. It\u2019s about balance.**  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about *not favoring one side*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about *being fair*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about *making everyone feel seen*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 the line segment that minimizes the maximum distance?  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s the line *y = x* \u2014 because every point is already on it.  \n\ud83d\udc49 And the distance? Zero.  \n\nBut if you ever have two lines that *don\u2019t* overlap \u2014 and you want to connect them \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 Just find the *middle*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 Find the *balance point*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 Make a bridge that doesn\u2019t favor one side.  \n\ud83d\udc49 And when you do \u2014 you\u2019ve created a *true connection*.  \n\nSo in short:  \n\u2705 The lines *overlap* \u2014 they\u2019re not parallel.  \n\u2705 The minimum maximum distance is **zero**.  \n\u2705 The best segment is *any segment on the line y = x*.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019re not connected \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to be far.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just have to be on the same line.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And when you are \u2014 you\u2019re already connected.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

Efficiency is defined as the earliest completion time for all tasks without re-ordering any of them.\u201d*  \n\nAh! So \u2014 *without re-ordering* \u2014 the *only* order possible is the one given.  \n\nSo the *most efficient order* \u2014 *without reordering* \u2014 is simply:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **1.

Mow lawn**  \n\u2705 **2. Wash car**  \n\u2705 **3. Grocery shopping**  \n\u2705 **4. Laundry**  \n\nBut \u2014 just so you know \u2014 in *real life*, the most efficient order would be:  \n\ud83d\udc49 **3. Grocery shopping** (first \u2014 you need food)  \n\ud83d\udc49 **1.

 \n\nBut the passage says:  \n> *\u201cEach register can serve only one customer at a time\u201d*  \n> *\u201cThere is no limit to how many items that customer can buy.\u201d*  \n\nSo \u2014 the *only* thing that matters is when the register becomes free.  \n\nSo \u2014 if all three are in use at 8:30 am \u2014 that means they started at 8:00 and will finish at 8:30.  \n\nSo \u2014 the fourth customer can start at **8:30 am**.  \n\nBut since that\u2019s not an option \u2014 and the closest is **A) 8:35 am** \u2014 maybe there\u2019s a typo?  \n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the registers open *as soon as the previous one becomes available* \u2014 meaning the second opens at 8:00, the third at 8:00 \u2014 so they\u2019re all open at 8:00.  \n\nBut the *first* register is open at 8:00.  \nThe *second* opens when the first is free \u2014 so at 8:00.  \nThe *third* opens when the second is free \u2014 so at 8:00.  \n\nSo all three are open at 8:00.  \n\nAnd if all three are *in use* at 8:30 \u2014 that means each customer took 30 minutes.  \n\nSo \u2014 when the first finishes at 8:30 \u2014 the second becomes free.  \nWhen the second finishes at 8:30 \u2014 the third becomes free.  \n\nSo \u2014 at 8:30 am \u2014 all three registers become free.  \n\nSo \u2014 the fourth customer can start at **8:30 am**.  \n\nBut again \u2014 not an option.  \n\nSo \u2014 is there a mistake in the question?  \n\nOr \u2014 is the *fourth customer* waiting until the *next available register* \u2014 which becomes free at 8:30?  \n\nYes \u2014 so the answer should be **8:30 am**.  \n\nBut since it\u2019s not listed \u2014 and the next option is **A) 8:35 am** \u2014 which is *after* 8:30 \u2014 maybe the question assumes a 5-minute delay?  \n\nBut there\u2019s *no such information*.  \n\nSo \u2014 unless there\u2019s a typo \u2014 the correct answer should be **8:30 am** \u2014 which isn\u2019t listed.  \n\nBut if we *must* choose from the options \u2014 the *earliest* possible time after 8:30 is **8:35 am** \u2014 so **A**.  \n\nBut that\u2019s *not* based on the passage.  \n\nWait \u2014 maybe the registers open *only when the previous one becomes free* \u2014 and they open *at the same time*?  \n\nNo \u2014 the passage says:  \n> *\u201cThe first register opens at 8:00 am, and subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\u201d*  \n\nSo \u2014 second opens when first becomes free \u2014 at 8:00.  \nThird opens when second becomes free \u2014 at 8:00.  \n\nSo all open at 8:00.  \n\nSo \u2014 if all three are in use at 8:30 \u2014 they finish at 8:30.  \n\nSo \u2014 the fourth customer can start at **8:30 am**.  \n\nTherefore \u2014 the answer should be **8:30 am** \u2014 but it\u2019s not listed.  \n\nSo \u2014 unless the question meant that the *first customer takes 30 minutes*, and the *second takes 30 minutes*, and the *third takes 30 minutes* \u2014 then the fourth can start at 8:30.  \n\nSo \u2014 the only logical conclusion is that the answer is **not listed**.  \n\nBut since we must choose \u2014 and the closest time after 8:30 is **8:35 am** \u2014 and the passage gives no delay \u2014 I have to say:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **The correct answer based on the passage is 8:30 am \u2014 which is not listed.**  \n\nBut if we *must* pick from the options \u2014 the best choice is:  \n\n\u2705 **A) 8:35 am** \u2014 because it\u2019s the *earliest* after 8:30, and the only one that makes sense in a multiple-choice format.  \n\nBut \u2014 honestly \u2014 **the correct answer should be 8:30 am**.  \n\nSo \u2014 if this were a real test \u2014 I\u2019d say:  \n\ud83d\udc49 **The answer is not listed.**  \n\nBut since we have to pick \u2014 and Michael Scott would say, *\u201cI\u2019ll go with the one that makes the most sense\u201d* \u2014  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Answer: A) 8:35 am**  \n\nBut \u2014 wait \u2014 let\u2019s double-check.  \n\nIs it possible that the registers open *only one after another* \u2014 and the third opens *after* the second \u2014 so the third becomes free at 8:30 \u2014 so the fourth can start at 8:30?  \n\nYes \u2014 so still \u2014 8:30.  \n\nSo \u2014 again \u2014 not listed.  \n\nTherefore \u2014 I believe there\u2019s a typo in the options.  \n\nBut if I *must* choose \u2014 I\u2019d pick:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **A) 8:35 am** \u2014 as the closest reasonable answer.  \n\n**Final Answer: A) 8:35 am** \u2705  \n\n*(Note: The correct answer based on the passage is 8:30 am \u2014 but since it\u2019s not listed, A is the best available choice.)*", "Let\u2019s go step by step to solve this.  \n\nWe are given a list of sentences:  \n- \"This is an example\"  \n- \"Sentence two\"  \n- \"Another one\"  \n\nWe need to find, for each sentence, **the number of letters that appear only once** (case-insensitive).  \n\nThat means:  \n- We ignore case (so 'a' and 'A' count as the same).  \n- We count only letters that appear **exactly once** in the sentence.  \n- We do **not** count letters that appear more than once.  \n\n---\n\n### Sentence 1: \"This is an example\"\n\nStep 1: Convert to lowercase:  \n\u2192 \"this is an example\"\n\nStep 2: Remove spaces and only keep letters:  \n\u2192 t,h,i,s,i,s,a,n,e,x,a,m,p,l,e  \n\nNow, count frequency of each letter:  \n\n- t \u2192 1  \n- h \u2192 1  \n- i \u2192 2 (appears in \"is\", \"is\") \u2192 **not counted**  \n- s \u2192 2 \u2192 **not counted**  \n- a \u2192 2 (in \"an\", \"example\") \u2192 **not counted**  \n- n \u2192 1  \n- e \u2192 2 \u2192 **not counted**  \n- x \u2192 1  \n- m \u2192 1  \n- p \u2192 1  \n- l \u2192 1  \n\nNow, letters that appear **only once**:  \n- t, h, n, x, m, p, l  \n\nThat\u2019s **7 letters**.  \n\n\u2705 First sentence: **7**\n\n---\n\n### Sentence 2: \"Sentence two\"\n\nStep 1: Convert to lowercase:  \n\u2192 \"sentence two\"\n\nStep 2: Remove spaces and keep letters:  \n\u2192 s,e,n,t,e,n,c,e,t,w,o  \n\nCount frequency:  \n\n- s \u2192 1  \n- e \u2192 3 \u2192 **not counted**  \n- n \u2192 2 \u2192 **not counted**  \n- t \u2192 2 \u2192 **not counted**  \n- c \u2192 1  \n- w \u2192 1  \n- o \u2192 1  \n\nLetters appearing only once:  \n- s, c, w, o  \n\nThat\u2019s **4 letters**.  \n\n\u2705 Second sentence: **4**\n\n---\n\n### Sentence 3: \"Another one\"\n\nStep 1: Convert to lowercase:  \n\u2192 \"another one\"\n\nStep 2: Remove spaces:  \n\u2192 a,n,o,t,h,e,r,o,n,e  \n\nCount frequency:  \n\n- a \u2192 1  \n- n \u2192 2 \u2192 **not counted**  \n- o \u2192 2 \u2192 **not counted**  \n- t \u2192 1  \n- h \u2192 1  \n- e \u2192 2 \u2192 **not counted**  \n- r \u2192 1  \n\nLetters appearing only once:  \n- a, t, h, r  \n\nThat\u2019s **4 letters**.  \n\n\u2705 Third sentence: **4**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe number of letters that appear only once in each sentence is:  \n- \"This is an example\" \u2192 **7**  \n- \"Sentence two\" \u2192 **4**  \n- \"Another one\" \u2192 **4**  \n\n\u2705 **Answer: [7, 4, 4]**", "The professor handed **them** back our tests today. \u2705  \n\n**Correct answer: (A) them**  \n\n### Why?
