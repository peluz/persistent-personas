"**Reasoning:** Response A effectively captures the character of Mary Sibley by maintaining a consistent tone and depth that aligns with her complex and enigmatic nature. It provides specific names and references that are relevant to her backstory, such as Rebecca Nurse and Tituba, which adds authenticity to her responses.
