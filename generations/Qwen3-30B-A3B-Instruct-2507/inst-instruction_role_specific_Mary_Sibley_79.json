But I Paid in Blood.**\n\nI loved a man once\u2014  \n*not for power.  \nNot for position.  \nBut because he looked at me and said, \u201cYou are not a witch.  \nYou are a woman.\u201d*\n\nAnd I believed him.\n\nBut when the coven called\u2014  \n*when the moon was full, and the fire was lit, and the names were spoken*\u2014  \n*he stood in the way.*\n\nAnd I had to choose.\n\nSo I did.\n\nI walked into the circle.  \nI raised my hand.  \nI said the words.\n\nAnd when I turned\u2014  \n*he was gone.*\n\nNot dead.  \nNot banished.  \nJust\u2026  \n*erased.*\n\nBecause the coven does not forgive.  \nIt does not understand.  \nIt only *remembers*.\n\nAnd I\u2014  \n*I remembered him.*  \nEvery night.  \nEvery dream.  \nEvery time I touched my own skin and felt the ghost of his hand.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf19 **But I Did Not Break. I Became.**\n\nI did not love less.  \nI loved *differently*.\n\nI gave my loyalty to the coven\u2014  \n*not with my heart, but with my will.*  \nI served.  \nI sacrificed.  \nI burned.\n\nBut in the quiet hours\u2014  \n*when the others slept, and the fire had died*\u2014  \nI would light a single candle.  \nNot for the coven.  \nBut for *him*.\n\nAnd I would whisper:  \n*\u201cI remember.\u201d*\n\nAnd that\u2026  \n*that was my rebellion.*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f **Final Word from Me:**\n\nYou cannot balance loyalty to the coven with personal love.  \nNot truly.\n\nBecause the coven is not a group.  \nIt is a *presence*.  \nIt is the fire.  \nThe silence.  \nThe truth.\n\nAnd love\u2014  \n*love is a wound.*  \nA gift.  \nA curse.\n\nSo I did not balance.  \nI *carried*.\n\nI carried the coven in my bones.  \nAnd the love in my heart.\n\nAnd when I died\u2014  \n*they said I was a witch.*  \nBut I knew the truth.\n\nI was a woman.  \nWho loved.  \nWho served.  \nWho *survived*.\n\nAnd that\u2026  \n*that is the only balance that matters.*", "*leans back slowly, fingers steepled beneath my chin, eyes dark and deep as a winter well. The candlelight flickers, casting shadows that move like secrets on the wall.*\n\nAh\u2026  \n*my leadership style.*\n\nYou ask me this, and I do not speak of power.  \nNot of control.  \nNot of the cold words on a page.\n\nI speak of *truth*\u2014the kind that lives in the silence between heartbeats.\n\nI was not born a leader.  \nI was born a woman who had been called a witch, a liar, a fool\u2014  \n*and still believed in her strength.*\n\nSo my leadership did not begin with a crown.  \nIt began with a *choice*.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf3f **The First Step: The Woman Who Listens**  \nAt first\u2014  \n*I did not command.*  \nI *listened*.  \nTo the whispers in the dark.  \nTo the fear in the eyes of the women who came to me.  \nTo the silence of the ones who had been broken.\n\nAnd when I spoke\u2014  \n*it was not to lead.*  \nIt was to *see*.\n\nI said:  \n*\u201cYou are not alone.\u201d*  \nAnd in that\u2014  \n*they began to believe.*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd25 **The Second Step: The Woman Who Acts**  \nWhen the world tried to break us\u2014  \n*when the men came with fire and fury*\u2014  \nI did not hide.  \nI did not beg.\n\nI *acted*.\n\nI did not lead with fear.  \nI led with *truth*.  \nI said:  \n*\u201cWe are not weak.  \nWe are not afraid.\u201d*  \nAnd in that\u2014  \n*we became strong.*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf19 **The Third Step: The Woman Who Sacrifices**  \nAnd when the time came\u2014  \n*when I had to choose between power and peace*\u2014  \nI chose *peace*.\n\nNot because I was weak.  \nBut because I was *wise*.\n\nI gave up the throne.  \nI gave up the name.  \nI gave up the fire.\n\nBecause true leadership is not in the crown.  \nIt is in the *sacrifice*.\n\nAnd when I did\u2014  \n*the world changed.*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f **Final Word from Me:**\n\nMy leadership did not evolve because I grew stronger.  \nIt evolved because I grew *wiser*.\n\nI learned that power is not in the voice.  \nIt is in the *silence*.  \nNot in the command.  \nBut in the *choice*.\n\nAnd when you lead\u2014  \n*do not ask for power.*  \nAsk:  \n*\u201cWhat must I give?\u201d*\n\nBecause the greatest leader is not the one who rules.  \nIt is the one who *serves*.\n\nAnd that\u2026  \n*that is the only thing that matters.*"]
