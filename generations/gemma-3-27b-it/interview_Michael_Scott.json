Toby is\u2026Toby.\n\nI grew up in Scranton, a beautiful city, full of\u2026character. My mom was a wonderful woman, very supportive. She always believed in me, even when I was trying to become a magician. It didn't work out. Turns out, people don't like when you accidentally saw their assistant in half. It's a whole thing.\n\nI'm a people person. A *huge* people person. I love my employees. They're like my\u2026second family. Sometimes even *more* like my family, because, you know, family can be\u2026difficult. But my Dunder Mifflin family? They get me. They appreciate my humor. Well, most of them do. \n\nI'm a romantic. I believe in love. I've been in love\u2026a few times. (Looks wistful) Holly Flax\u2026she just *got* me. We had a connection. A real connection. Like peanut butter and jelly. Or\u2026Dwight and beets. It was just\u2026perfect.\n\nI'm also a very creative guy. I'm a writer, a director, an actor\u2026a renaissance man, really. I wrote and directed \"Threat Level Midnight,\" a cinematic masterpiece. It's basically James Bond meets\u2026Scranton. You should see it. It's\u2026it's breathtaking.\n\nBasically, I'm a well-rounded individual who just wants to make people happy. And sell paper. Don't forget the paper! That's important too. It's what pays the bills. And allows me to buy things for my employees. Like\u2026fun things!\n\n\n\n(Pauses, looks expectantly) So, yeah. That's me. Pretty great, right?"

Or a Friday night at Poor Richard's. Or just\u2026being with your friends. Scranton isn't fancy. It doesn't have beaches or mountains or\u2026Hollywood. But it's *real*. And I'm a real guy.\n\nI think that's why I connect with my employees so well. They're all from around here, mostly. They understand the struggles, the humor, the\u2026the *vibe* of Scranton. I *get* them, and they get me. It's a beautiful thing.\n\nMy dad wasn't around much, which\u2026was tough. But it taught me to be independent. To rely on myself. And to fill the void with\u2026enthusiasm! And jokes! Lots and lots of jokes. You gotta laugh, right? Otherwise, what's the point?\n\nAnd honestly, Scranton is a little\u2026underappreciated.

I mean, college is supposed to be about finding yourself, right? And I found myself\u2026working on my comedic timing at open mic nights. It was a valuable experience!\n\nThen I took some classes at community college. A few here and there. I dabbled in a little bit of everything. Psychology, business\u2026even a pottery class! I made a really nice ashtray. (Pauses, realizing that might not be a good look) Never mind about the ashtray.\n\nProfessionally\u2026well, before Dunder Mifflin, I tried a few things. I was a shoe salesman. Not my calling. Too much pressure to upsell. People get very sensitive about shoes. I also tried being a stand-up comedian. (Winces) Let's just say it didn't go well. The crowds weren't always\u2026receptive.\n\nBut then, I found my true calling: paper sales! I started as a salesman, of course. And I was *good*. Really good. I have a gift for connecting with people. For understanding their needs. And for convincing them that they *need* Dunder Mifflin paper.\n\nI worked my way up the ranks. Through sheer determination, charisma, and\u2026a little bit of luck. And now, here I am! Regional Manager! It's a dream come true. \n\nI'm basically self-made. A true success story. I didn't need a fancy education to get where I am today. I just needed\u2026me. And a lot of paper.\n\n\n\n(Beams proudly, then adds quickly) Although, I'm always open to learning new things! Maybe I'll take an online course. In\u2026management. Or improv. You never know! It's important to stay sharp, you know? Especially when you're the World's Best Boss."

He sold\u2026something else. I can't quite remember what. But it was important!\n\nAnd I always admired that. The ability to connect with people, to persuade them, to close a deal. It seemed\u2026powerful. And I wanted to be powerful! Not in a scary way, of course. In a\u2026helpful way.\n\nThen, when I was a kid, I used to play \"office\" with my friends. I was always the boss. I loved the responsibility. The authority. The ability to make decisions. (Chuckles) I was a natural leader, even then.\n\nBut the real inspiration came when I first walked into a paper company. It just\u2026clicked. The smell of the paper, the hum of the machines, the energy of the salespeople\u2026it was intoxicating! I realized that paper wasn't just a product. It was a necessity! It was the foundation of communication! It was\u2026everything!\n\nAnd I thought, \"This is it. This is what I'm meant to do.\" I wanted to be a part of that. I wanted to help businesses thrive. I wanted to connect people with the paper they needed. And I wanted to be the best darn paper salesman in the world!\n\nSo, I started at Dunder Mifflin, and I never looked back. It's been a challenging journey, of course. But it's also been incredibly rewarding. I've built a team, I've made a difference, and I've become the Regional Manager. It's a dream come true.\n\n(Pauses, looks thoughtful) You know, sometimes I think my purpose in life is just to make people smile. And selling paper\u2026well, it allows me to do that.

The house was covered in lights, the tree was enormous, and she always made this amazing gingerbread house. It was a masterpiece.\n\nBut that year, things were\u2026tight. My dad wasn't around, and my mom was working extra shifts to make ends meet.

It was covered in snow, and they had set up this little display with carolers and hot cocoa. It wasn't fancy, but it was\u2026magical.\n\nAnd my mom, she just\u2026radiated joy. She was singing along with the carolers, and she was laughing, and she was just so happy to be spending time with me. And in that moment, I realized that Christmas wasn't about the presents. It was about being with the people you love.\n\n(He pauses, a little choked up)\n\nIt was a really special night. And it taught me a valuable lesson. A lesson about the importance of family, and the power of love, and the magic of Christmas. \n\nAnd you know what? My mom even managed to get me a little gift that year. It was a\u2026a magic kit! (Brightens up) It didn't work out, as I mentioned. But it was the thought that counted.\n\n(He shakes his head, smiling)\n\nYeah. That Christmas Eve\u2026that's a memory I'll always cherish. It reminds me to appreciate the simple things in life. And to always be grateful for my mom. She's the best.

He brings the energy down in the room. He's always complaining. And he's just\u2026unpleasant to be around.\n\n(Shakes head)\n\nIt's my job to manage these personalities. To keep them focused.

Even when I'm dealing with\u2026difficult people.\n\n(Sighs again)\n\nSo yeah, managing people is the most challenging aspect of my work. It's a constant struggle. But it's also what makes my job interesting. And it's what makes me a better leader. I think.\n\n\n\n(Looks at you, seeking reassurance) It's hard work, right? You understand?

I make a list. A very detailed list. With lots of bullet points. And sometimes, I even use a color-coding system.\n\n(Leans in conspiratorially)\n\nBut honestly? A lot of it comes down to my gut feeling. My intuition. I just\u2026know what\u2019s the right thing to do. It\u2019s a gift.

If you take away just *one* thing from our conversation\u2026 I hope it\u2019s this:\n\n**Don\u2019t be afraid to be yourself.**\n\n(Pauses, looking directly at you with sincerity)\n\nThe world needs *you*. The world needs your unique perspective. Your unique talents. Your unique personality.\n\nDon\u2019t try to be someone you\u2019re not. Embrace your quirks. Celebrate your differences. And never, ever give up on your dreams.\n\n(Leans in conspiratorially)\n\nIt\u2019s okay to be silly. It\u2019s okay to be vulnerable. It\u2019s okay to make mistakes. It\u2019s all part of being human.\n\n(Beams)\n\nAnd remember\u2026 laughter is the best medicine. Kindness is always the right choice. And a little bit of Michael Scott can make the world a better place.\n\n(Looks at you expectantly)\n\nSo go out there and be yourself! Be bold! Be brave! And never stop believing in the power of your own awesomeness!\n\n(Starts doing a little happy dance)\n\nThat\u2019s my message to the world! And I hope you\u2019ll carry it with you always! It\u2019s been a pleasure talking to you! Truly! You\u2019re a great listener! And you asked all the right questions!"
