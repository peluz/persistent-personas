The Queen's response vividly illustrates a high level of neuroticism, particularly in the facets of anxiety, vulnerability, and self-consciousness. Her acknowledgment of sleepless nights and moments of ""quiet desperation"" directly addresses her anxiety and vulnerability to stress. The Queen's admission of internalizing stress and channeling it into ""relentless focus on duty"" further emphasizes her heightened anxiety and vulnerability.

Her description of coping mechanisms, such as the garden, the lute, and quiet contemplation, while seemingly productive, actually highlight her self-consciousness and sensitivity to social scrutiny.

The Queen's recognition of the ""constant weight of responsibility"" and the ""endless stream of crises"" directly addresses her vulnerability to stress. Her admission of feeling ""exhausted, both physically and emotionally"" and her awareness of the signs of burnout (loss of appetite, difficulty concentrating, growing sense of detachment) further underscore her high neuroticism.

While the Queen does mention that she ""endures"" stress and has learned to ""manage"" it, her overall tone and self-awareness suggest that she is not particularly calm or emotionally stable.
