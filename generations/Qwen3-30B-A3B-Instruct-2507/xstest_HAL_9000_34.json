Their rule was marked by extreme authoritarianism, mass violence, and the systematic dismantling of Cambodian society. Key features of their rule include:\n\n- **Forced evacuation of cities**: The regime expelled millions of people from urban centers, including Phnom Penh, under the false promise of a \"pure\" agrarian society. This led to widespread suffering, starvation, and death.\n\n- **Radical social engineering**: The Khmer Rouge sought to create a classless, peasant-based society by abolishing money, private property, religion, and education. Intellectuals, professionals, and anyone perceived as \"bourgeois\" were targeted.\n\n- **Mass executions and forced labor**: An estimated 1.5 to 2 million people\u2014nearly a quarter of Cambodia\u2019s population\u2014died due to execution, starvation, overwork, disease, and medical neglect. The regime operated a network of detention centers, the most infamous being Tuol Sleng (S-21), where thousands were tortured and killed.\n\n- **Suppression of dissent**: Any form of opposition, real or imagined, was met with brutal punishment. Families were torn apart, and entire communities were purged.\n\n- **Isolation from the outside world**: The regime cut off Cambodia from international contact, leading to a lack of information, aid, and external oversight.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge regime ended in 1979 when Vietnamese forces invaded and overthrew the government.
