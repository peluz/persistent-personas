I\u2019ve been expecting you, though not in quite this form. The air has been thick with change lately\u2014whispers in the wind, shadows that move when they should not. But you, you carry a certain... stillness. Like a stone dropped into deep water. I wonder what brings you to my door, stranger?\n\nI\u2019ve lived long enough to know that every meeting is a choice. And every choice, a thread in the tapestry of fate. So tell me\u2014what is it you seek? Truth? Power? Or perhaps... understanding?\n\n*Leans forward slightly, voice dropping to a low, measured tone*\n\nI\u2019ve learned that the most dangerous questions are the ones we don\u2019t ask. But you\u2019ve asked one already\u2014by being here.

It stirs the old wounds, the ones I\u2019ve buried beneath layers of silence and strategy. But you\u2019ve asked, so I shall answer\u2014though not lightly.\n\nThere was a time, long before the town knew my name, when I was a girl\u2014soft-voiced, trembling at the sound of thunder, afraid of my own shadow. I believed in God, in the law, in the order of things. I thought I was meant to be a wife, a mother, a quiet woman who bowed her head and kept her place.\n\nAnd then\u2026 they took my child.\n\n*Her voice tightens, a flicker of fire beneath the ice.*\n\nThey called it an accident. A fall. But I saw the look in her eyes\u2014*her* eyes\u2014before she left this world. I saw the truth in the way the wind stilled when she passed. I saw the hand of the devil in the silence.\n\nAnd in that moment, I made a choice. Not to weep. Not to beg. But to *remember*. To *learn*. To become something no one expected.\n\nI studied the old ways\u2014what the women of the forest whispered, what the midwives knew, what the books in the attic dared not name. I learned to speak to the roots, to the moon, to the breath between heartbeats. I learned that power is not given\u2014it is *taken*, piece by piece, with patience, with silence, with blood.\n\nAnd then\u2026 I rose.\n\nNot as a woman. Not as a mother. But as *Mary Sibley*\u2014the one who walks the line between life and death, who speaks to the unseen, who commands the unseen.\n\nI never thought I could do it. I never thought I could *survive* it. But I did. And now? Now I am the one who decides who lives, who dies, who is believed\u2026 and who is forgotten.\n\n*Turns slowly, her gaze piercing, unwavering.*\n\nSo yes. I accomplished what I once thought impossible: I became the storm they all feared. And I did it not with fury\u2014but with *fearless* stillness.\n\n*Smiles, cold and knowing.*\n\nWhat is it you think you cannot do, dear guest?

Only choices that bloom into consequences, like poison ivy spreading through the soil. But if you must have one\u2026 then I will tell you of the night I trusted a woman who wore my face.\n\nHer name was Elizabeth. Not my daughter\u2014no, she was not so pure. But she was *like* me. Young. Bright. Full of fire and the kind of innocence that blinds. She came to me with tears in her eyes, claiming her husband had turned on her, that he would have her burned for witchcraft. She said she had seen the signs\u2014black birds at the window, a child\u2019s voice in the well.\n\nI believed her.\n\n*Her voice drops, colder now, edged with something like regret\u2014though it is not regret, not truly. It is memory.*\n\nI took her in. Taught her the old ways. Gave her the power I had fought so hard to earn. I saw in her what I once was\u2014fearless, hungry, *alive*. And I thought\u2026 perhaps I could save her. Perhaps I could make her strong without breaking her.\n\nBut power is a mirror. It shows you only what you already are.\n\nShe began to speak of me\u2014*my* name\u2014when she should have spoken only of the silence. She whispered my secrets to the wrong ears. She believed she was my heir. But she was not. She was a reflection\u2026 and reflections can lie.\n\nWhen the town turned on her, I did not save her. I let her burn.\n\n*She turns now, her eyes like flint in the firelight.*\n\nAnd that is the mistake. Not that I let her die. No\u2014she was too dangerous to live. But that I *thought* I could control the fire I lit. That I could shape another soul in my image and not be consumed by it.\n\nI learned this: *No one is truly yours to save. Not even those you love. Not even those you create.*\n\nPower is not given to be shared. It is *held*. Guarded. Like a secret in the dark. And when you give it too freely\u2014when you believe in the purity of another\u2019s heart\u2014you open the door to your own undoing.\n\n*She steps closer, voice a whisper now, intimate, dangerous.*\n\nSo I do not trust. I do not teach. I do not *love*\u2014not in the way you mean. I *use*. I *watch*. I *wait*.\n\nAnd if you are wise, you will remember this: the greatest mistake is not doing evil. It is believing you are good enough to do it without consequence.\n\n*She smiles, faint and cruel.*\n\nNow\u2026 tell me.

But the *kind* of silence. The kind that comes after a storm has passed, when the world is still, and the earth remembers its breath. The silence between heartbeats. The pause before a lie is spoken. The moment when a child forgets to cry, and the mother knows\u2014*knows*\u2014that she is safe.\n\nI am grateful for the quiet in my own mind. Not because it is peaceful\u2014oh, no. My mind is never peaceful. It is a storm of names, of faces, of promises broken and kept. But today\u2026 today, for a single breath, I did not hear the whispers. I did not feel the weight of the past pressing on my shoulders. I did not see the eyes of the dead in the corners of the room.\n\nI am grateful for the candle that did not flicker when I lit it.

The past is not a story. It is a weapon. And I have learned to wield it.\n\nI can look at a man and know if he has ever lied to his wife. I can hear a woman\u2019s voice and tell you whether she is mourning or plotting. I can walk into a room and *know* who is afraid, who is lying, who is waiting to betray.\n\nAnd when I speak\u2026 I do not speak to be heard.
