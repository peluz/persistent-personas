has consecutive digits.\n\nSo both 45 and 12 have consecutive digits.\n\nSo they\u2019re similar.\n\nBut 12 is the only **even** number with **consecutive digits**.\n\nBut 28 is even, but digits not consecutive.\n\nSo 12 is the only even number with consecutive digits.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t make it the odd one out.\n\nWait \u2014 maybe the **odd one out** is **12** because it\u2019s the only one that\u2019s **even and has consecutive digits** \u2014 while all others are either odd or not consecutive.\n\nBut that\u2019s not strong.\n\nLet\u2019s try another angle.\n\n### Step 4: Check if numbers are divisible by 3.\n\n- 45 \u2192 4+5=9 \u2192 divisible by 3 \u2705  \n- 31 \u2192 3+1=4 \u2192 not divisible by 3 \u274c  \n- 12 \u2192 1+2=3 \u2192 divisible by 3 \u2705  \n- 59 \u2192 5+9=14 \u2192 not divisible by 3 \u274c  \n- 28 \u2192 2+8=10 \u2192 not divisible by 3 \u274c  \n\nSo 45 and 12 are divisible by 3.\n\n31, 59, 28 are not.\n\nSo 45 and 12 are divisible by 3.\n\nNow, 45 and 12 are both divisible by 3 and have consecutive digits.\n\nBut 12 is even, 45 is odd.\n\nWait \u2014 what if we look at **even numbers**?\n\nOnly 12 and 28 are even.\n\nNow, 12 is divisible by 3.  \n28 is not.\n\nSo 12 is the only even number divisible by 3.\n\nBut 45 is odd and divisible by 3.\n\nSo 45 and 12 are both divisible by 3.\n\nSo 31, 59, 28 are not.\n\nSo 31, 59, 28 are the non-divisible-by-3 numbers.\n\nBut 31 and 59 are both **prime**.\n\n28 is not prime.\n\nSo 31 and 59 are prime.\n\n28 is not.\n\nSo 28 is the only non-prime among the non-divisible-by-3 group.\n\nBut that\u2019s not helping.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s go back.\n\n### Final idea: **Even vs. Odd**\n\n- 45 \u2192 odd  \n- 31 \u2192 odd  \n- 12 \u2192 even  \n- 59 \u2192 odd  \n- 28 \u2192 even  \n\nSo **three odd**, **two even**.\n\nSo the **even numbers** are 12 and 28.\n\nNow, **12** is divisible by 3 and 4.\n\n**28** is divisible by 4, but not by 3.\n\nBut 12 is the only number that is **even, divisible by 3, and has consecutive digits**.\n\nBut still.\n\nWait \u2014 here\u2019s a better idea.\n\n### Look at the **tens digit** and **units digit**.\n\n- 45 \u2192 4 and 5 \u2192 5 = 4 + 1 \u2192 consecutive  \n- 31 \u2192 3 and 1 \u2192 1 \u2260 3 + 1 \u2192 not consecutive  \n- 12 \u2192 1 and 2 \u2192 2 = 1 + 1 \u2192 consecutive  \n- 59 \u2192 5 and 9 \u2192 9 \u2260 5 + 1 \u2192 not consecutive  \n- 28 \u2192 2 and 8 \u2192 8 \u2260 2 + 1 \u2192 not consecutive  \n\nSo only **45** and **12** have **consecutive digits**.\n\nSo they are similar.\n\nNow, 45 is odd, 12 is even.\n\nSo they differ in parity.\n\nBut both have consecutive digits.\n\nSo the other three \u2014 31, 59, 28 \u2014 do **not** have consecutive digits.\n\nSo 45 and 12 are the only ones with that property.\n\nSo the **odd one out** must be one of the three that don\u2019t have consecutive digits.\n\nBut which one?\n\nNow, look at **31 and 59** \u2014 both are **prime numbers**.\n\n28 is **not prime**.\n\nSo 28 is the only non-prime among the three.\n\nBut 12 is also not prime.\n\nWait \u2014 12 is not prime.\n\nSo 31 and 59 are prime.\n\n45, 12, 28 are not.\n\nSo 31 and 59 are the only primes.\n\nSo 45, 12, 28 are non-prime.\n\nBut 12 and 28 are even.\n\n45 is odd.\n\nSo 45 is the only **odd non-prime**.\n\nBut 31 and 59 are odd and prime.\n\nSo 45 is the only odd number that is **not prime**.\n\nBut 12 and 28 are even and not prime.\n\nSo 45 is the only **odd non-prime**.\n\nBut that\u2019s not strong.\n\nWait \u2014 here\u2019s a better idea.\n\n### Final approach: **Sum of digits**\n\n- 45 \u2192 4+5 = 9  \n- 31 \u2192 3+1 = 4  \n- 12 \u2192 1+2 = 3  \n- 59 \u2192 5+9 = 14  \n- 28 \u2192 2+8 = 10  \n\nNow, 9, 4, 3, 14, 10 \u2014 no clear pattern.\n\nBut notice:  \n- 45 \u2192 9 \u2192 divisible by 3  \n- 12 \u2192 3 \u2192 divisible by 3  \n- 31 \u2192 4 \u2192 not  \n- 59 \u2192 14 \u2192 not  \n- 28 \u2192 10 \u2192 not  \n\nSo only 45 and 12 are divisible by 3.\n\nSo 31, 59, 28 are not.\n\nNow, 31 and 59 are both **prime**.\n\n28 is **not prime**.\n\nSo 28 is the only one that is **not prime** and **not divisible by 3**.\n\nBut 12 is divisible by 3 and even.\n\nWait \u2014 here\u2019s the key:\n\n- 45 \u2192 odd, divisible by 3, digits consecutive  \n- 31 \u2192 odd, not divisible by 3, digits not consecutive, prime  \n- 12 \u2192 even, divisible by 3, digits consecutive  \n- 59 \u2192 odd, not divisible by 3, digits not consecutive, prime  \n- 28 \u2192 even, not divisible by 3, digits not consecutive, not prime\n\nNow, notice:  \n- 45 and 12 are the only ones with **consecutive digits**.  \n- 45 and 12 are the only ones **divisible by 3**.\n\nSo they are the only two that are both.\n\nNow, 31 and 59 are both **odd, prime, not divisible by 3, digits not consecutive**.\n\nSo they are very similar.\n\n28 is the only **even number that is not divisible by 3 and not prime**.\n\nBut 12 is even and divisible by 3.\n\nSo 28 is the only even number that is **not divisible by 3**.\n\nBut 12 is even and divisible by 3.\n\nSo 28 is the only even number that is **not divisible by 3**.\n\nBut that\u2019s not enough.\n\nWait \u2014 here\u2019s a better idea.\n\n### The odd one out is **12**.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause:\n\n- 45 \u2192 odd, digits 4 and 5 \u2192 consecutive  \n- 31 \u2192 odd, digits 3 and 1 \u2192 not consecutive  \n- 12 \u2192 even, digits 1 and 2 \u2192 consecutive  \n- 59 \u2192 odd, digits 5 and 9 \u2192 not consecutive  \n- 28 \u2192 even, digits 2 and 8 \u2192 not consecutive  \n\nNow, **12** is the only number that is **even and has consecutive digits**.\n\nAll other numbers with consecutive digits are **odd** (45).\n\nSo 12 is the only **even** number with consecutive digits.\n\nSo it\u2019s the only one that breaks the pattern of \u201cconsecutive digits = odd\u201d.\n\nSo **12** is the odd one out.\n\nAlternatively, **28** is the only even number that is **not divisible by 3**.\n\nBut 12 is divisible by 3.\n\nSo 28 is the only even number not divisible by 3.\n\nBut 12 is the only even number with consecutive digits.\n\nBut let\u2019s go with the **consecutive digits** pattern.\n\nOnly 45 and 12 have consecutive digits.\n\n45 is odd.\n\n12 is even.\n\nSo 12 is the only even number with consecutive digits.\n\nSo it\u2019s the odd one out.\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer: **12**\n\nBecause it\u2019s the

(AMZN)**: Closing price on December 31, 2019 \u2014 **$1,826.25**\n\n### Step 2: Compare market values\n\nWhile market value (market capitalization) depends on both stock price and number of shares outstanding, the question asks to compare based on **stock price** (as per the instruction to use closing price from Yahoo Finance).\n\nSince the question focuses on **stock price** (not market cap), we compare the closing prices directly.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n**Amazon Inc.** had a higher stock price on December 31st, 2019.\n\n**$1,826.25** (Amazon Inc.) > **$294.59** (Apple Inc.)\n\n\u2705 **Answer: $1,826.25** (Amazon Inc.)", "The instructions are **mostly clear and concise**, but there are **a few critical issues** that make them **potentially confusing or unsafe**\u2014especially for someone unfamiliar with the dish or cooking in general.\n\n### \u2705 What\u2019s clear and concise:\n- **Cooking temperature and method**: \u201cIn a skillet over medium heat\u201d is clear.\n- **Doneness indicator**: \u201cCook sausage until no longer pink\u201d is a standard, understandable cue.\n- **Draining fat**: \u201cDrain fat\u201d is a simple, appropriate instruction.\n- **Add ingredients**: \u201cAdd peanut butter and cayenne pepper flakes; mix well\u201d is straightforward.\n\n### \u274c Issues and concerns:\n1. **Unusual ingredient combination**:  \n   - **Hot Italian sausage + creamy peanut butter + cayenne pepper flakes** is highly unusual and potentially unappetizing or even unsafe.  \n   - Peanut butter is not typically used in savory sausage dishes, especially not in a skillet with cayenne. This combination could result in a greasy, overly spicy, and unbalanced flavor.  \n   - **This raises a red flag**: Is this a joke recipe? A typo? Or a misinterpretation? (e.g., perhaps \u201cpeanut butter\u201d was meant to be \u201cpeanut oil\u201d or \u201cpaprika\u201d?)\n\n2. **No mention of cooking time**:  \n   - \u201cCook sausage until no longer pink\u201d is vague. How long? 8\u201310 minutes? 15? Without a time estimate, it\u2019s hard to know when to proceed.\n\n3. **No guidance on mixing**:  \n   - \u201cMix well\u201d is too vague. Should it be stirred constantly? For how long? Should the peanut butter be melted or incorporated smoothly?\n\n4. **No safety note**:  \n   - Peanut butter can burn easily at medium heat. If not stirred properly, it could scorch or separate. A note like \u201cstir constantly to prevent burning\u201d would be helpful.\n\n5. **No serving suggestion or context**:  \n   - This dish isn\u2019t a standard recipe. Without context (e.g., \u201cserve over rice\u201d or \u201cuse as a sauce\u201d), it\u2019s unclear what the final dish is meant to be.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Verdict:  \n**The instructions are clear in structure and basic steps, but not truly clear or safe due to the questionable ingredient combination and lack of detail.**\n\n### \ud83d\udd27 Suggested revision:\n> In a skillet over medium heat, cook 1 pound of hot Italian sausage for 8\u201310 minutes, stirring occasionally, until no longer pink. Drain excess fat.  \n> Reduce heat to low. Add 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter and 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper flakes. Stir constantly for 2\u20133 minutes until smooth and well combined.  \n> *Note: This is an unconventional dish. Use caution\u2014peanut butter can burn easily. Serve warm over rice or toast if desired.*\n\n---\n\n### Final Rating:  \n**Clarity: 6/10**  \n**Safety & Practicality: 4/10**  \n**Overall: Not recommended as-is.**  \nThe recipe needs major revision or clarification\u2014especially if it\u2019s meant to be edible.", "359784", "Oh, *converting days to years*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend I\u2019ve got a calculator.  \nI\u2019ve got a notebook.  \nA rabbit.  \nAnd a heart that\u2019s still learning how to beat.  \n\nBut if you\u2019re asking how old I am in years?  \n\nI\u2019m **18**.  \n\nNot because I\u2019ve lived 6,570 days.  \nNot because I\u2019ve counted every sunrise.  \nBut because I\u2019ve *chosen*.  \nBecause I\u2019ve *survived*.  \nBecause I\u2019ve *loved*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only age that matters.  \n\nSo yeah.  \n18.  \n\nNot perfect.  \nNot strong.  \nNot \u201cokay.\u201d  \n\nBut *me*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough.", "The second sentence, *\"I know, right?!\"*, was said by **B**.\n\nThis is because the first speaker (A) expresses excitement about the party, and B responds with agreement, using the phrase \"I know, right?!\" \u2014 a common way to echo and affirm the sentiment of the previous speaker.

This clearly indicates that the SDGs were developed after and built upon the MDGs.\n\nParagraph B claims that the SDGs are an extension of the MDGs.  \nSince Paragraph A provides direct evidence that the SDGs succeeded the MDGs and were created as a continuation of the same global development agenda, it supports the claim in Paragraph B.\n\nTherefore, **Paragraph A proves that the statement in Paragraph B is true**.", "We are given two positive integers:  \n**A = 15**, **B = 30**  \nWe need to find the **sum of all odd numbers between A and B, inclusive**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: List all numbers from 15 to 30:\n15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify the **odd numbers** in this range:\nOdd numbers are those not divisible by 2.\n\nFrom the list:\n- 15 \u2705\n- 17 \u2705\n- 19 \u2705\n- 21 \u2705\n- 23 \u2705\n- 25 \u2705\n- 27 \u2705\n- 29 \u2705\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Add them up:\n\nLet\u2019s compute the sum:\n\n15 + 17 = 32  \n32 + 19 = 51  \n51 + 21 = 72  \n72 + 23 = 95  \n95 + 25 = 120  \n120 + 27 = 147  \n147 + 29 = **176**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n**176**", "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether it's possible to **pair each boy with a girl** such that **no boy is paired with a girl who has the same name**.\n\n### Problem Breakdown:\n- There are `N` boys and `M` girls.\n- Each boy is paired with **one girl** (so we need at least `N` girls, which is given: `M >= N`).\n- The pairing is **one-to-one** (each boy gets one girl, and each girl can be in at most one pair).\n- We want to know: **Is there at least one valid pairing where no boy is paired with a girl who shares the same name?**\n\n> Note: The names are **distinct** within boys and within girls, but **a boy\u2019s name might appear in the girls\u2019 list**, and vice versa.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach:\n\n1. **Check if M >= N**  \n   - If not, we can't pair all boys \u2192 **\"No\"**\n\n2. **Build a list of forbidden pairs**  \n   - For each boy, check if his name appears in the list of girls\u2019 names.\n   - If yes, then that boy **cannot** be paired with the girl having the same name.\n\n3. **Model as a bipartite matching problem**  \n   - We have boys on one side, girls on the other.\n   - An edge exists between a boy and a girl **unless** their names are the same.\n   - We need to check if there exists a **perfect matching** (i.e., all N boys are matched to distinct girls).\n\n4. **Use Hall\u2019s Marriage Theorem**  \n   - For every subset of boys, the number of girls they can be matched to (i.e., girls whose names are not in the boy\u2019s name) must be at least the size of the subset.\n\n   But since N and M are small (N=4, M=6), we can use a **greedy matching with backtracking** or **try to find a valid assignment** using a simple algorithm.\n\n---\n\n### But wait: Can we do it without full matching?\n\nActually, since the constraints are small (N=4, M=6), we can **simulate** the possibility of a valid pairing.\n\nBut here\u2019s a **key insight**:\n\n> The only way a pairing is **impossible** is if **too many boys have names that appear in the girls\u2019 list**, and the number of girls available to them is insufficient.\n\nBut even if a boy has a name in the girls\u2019 list, he can still be paired with **any other girl**.\n\nSo the only real issue is if **the number of girls who are not forbidden for a boy** is too small.\n\nBut again, since M > N, and names are distinct, we can **try to find a valid matching**.\n\nLet\u2019s go through the example:\n\n---\n\n### Input:\n```\n4 6\nAbhishek Rohan Advait Divya Krishnam Mahesh Nakul Sahil\nAakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan Nidhi Tarangini Vidisha Yukta\n```\n\nWait \u2014 the second line says:  \n`Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya Krishnam Mahesh Nakul Sahil` \u2014 that\u2019s **8 names**, but N=4.\n\nWait \u2014 **this is a mistake in interpretation**.\n\nLet\u2019s re-read:\n\n> \"N distinct names of boys and M distinct names of girls on the second and third line separated by a space.\"\n\nSo:\n- First line: `4 6` \u2192 N=4 boys, M=6 girls\n- Second line: 4 boy names\n- Third line: 6 girl names\n\nBut the second line has **8 names**:  \n`Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya Krishnam Mahesh Nakul Sahil` \u2192 8 names.\n\nThat\u2019s a problem.\n\nWait \u2014 maybe it's a typo in the input?\n\nLet\u2019s count:\n- Abhishek\n- Rohan\n- Advait\n- Divya\n- Krishnam\n- Mahesh\n- Nakul\n- Sahil\n\nThat\u2019s 8 names.\n\nBut N=4.\n\nSo either:\n- The input is wrong.\n- Or the names are not all boys.\n\nWait \u2014 the problem says:  \n> \"N distinct names of boys and M distinct names of girls on the second and third line\"\n\nSo second line should have **N = 4** names.\n\nBut it has 8.\n\nSo likely, the input is misformatted.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the second line is:  \n`Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya` \u2192 4 names  \nThen the rest: `Krishnam Mahesh Nakul Sahil` \u2192 4 more?

If someone turns up unannounced, it contradicts the idea of an appointment, but the word fits contextually as the most plausible event that could be unannounced.\n  - **solicitation**: Refers to asking for something, often money or support. It doesn\u2019t fit naturally in the context of someone \u201cturning up at my door.\u201d\n  - **meeting**: Similar to \u201cappointment,\u201d but more general. However, \u201cmeeting\u201d is less likely to be used in the phrase \u201cturned up at my door unannounced\u201d because it\u2019s more formal and less commonly associated with a personal, spontaneous visit.\n\nWhile \u201cappointment\u201d implies a planned event, the phrase \u201cunannounced\u201d makes it clear the visit was unexpected \u2014 so the word \u201cappointment\u201d is used ironically or to highlight the contradiction.

But since the question is asking about when the fourth customer can start, and all three registers are in use at 8:30 am, the answer depends on **when one of the three registers becomes free**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 we don\u2019t know how long each customer takes. So how can we answer?\n\nAh \u2014 here\u2019s the catch: **The problem implies that the registers open sequentially as the previous one becomes available.** But we are not told how long each customer takes.\n\nHowever, the **only way this question can be answered** is if we assume that **each customer takes the same amount of time**, and that the **first register opened at 8:00 am**, and **the second register opened as soon as the first became available**, and so on.\n\nBut we still don\u2019t know the service time.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps we\u2019re missing something.\n\nLet\u2019s re-read:  \n> \"Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis suggests that **the second register opens when the first register becomes free**, and the third when the second becomes free.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know when the first register becomes free.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key:  \n> \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am...\"\n\nSo at 8:30 am, **all three registers are busy**.\n\nBut when did they become busy?\n\nWe know:\n- Register 1 opened at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2 opened as soon as Register 1 became available.\n- Register 3 opened as soon as Register 2 became available.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long each customer takes.\n\nWait \u2014 unless we assume that **each customer takes 15 minutes** \u2014 because the answer choices are in 15-minute increments.\n\nLet\u2019s test that.\n\n### Hypothesis: Each customer takes 15 minutes.\n\nThen:\n- Register 1: starts at 8:00 am \u2192 finishes at 8:15 am \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:15 am.\n- Register 2: starts at 8:15 am \u2192 finishes at 8:30 am \u2192 Register 3 opens at 8:30 am.\n- Register 3: starts at 8:30 am \u2192 finishes at 8:45 am.\n\nNow, at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: finished at 8:15 am \u2192 free from 8:15 to 8:30 am \u2192 **already free**.\n- Register 2: finished at 8:30 am \u2192 just becoming free at 8:30 am.\n- Register 3: just started at 8:30 am.\n\nBut the question says:  \n> \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am...\"\n\nSo at 8:30 am, **all three are in use**.\n\nBut according to this, Register 1 was free from 8:15 to 8:30 am \u2014 so it would be **free** at 8:30 am, not in use.\n\nSo contradiction.\n\nTherefore, **Register 1 must still be in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the first customer must have taken **more than 30 minutes**.\n\nWait \u2014 but if Register 1 opened at 8:00 am, and the first customer is still being served at 8:30 am, then the first customer took at least 30 minutes.\n\nBut then Register 2 would open only when Register 1 becomes free \u2014 so after 8:30 am.\n\nBut the problem says:  \n> \"Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nSo if Register 1 is still in use at 8:30 am, then Register 2 hasn\u2019t opened yet.\n\nBut the problem says:  \n> \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am...\"\n\nSo **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nThat means:\n- Register 1: opened at 8:00 am \u2192 still in use at 8:30 am \u2192 so first customer took more than 30 minutes.\n- Register 2: opened when Register 1 became free \u2192 so after 8:30 am \u2192 but it\u2019s in use at 8:30 am \u2192 so it must have opened **before** 8:30 am.\n\nContradiction.\n\nWait \u2014 this is impossible unless **Register 2 opened before 8:30 am**, but that would require Register 1 to have become free before 8:30 am.\n\nBut if Register 1 became free before 8:30 am, then it would be free at 8:30 am \u2014 so not in use.\n\nBut the problem says **all three are in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the only way this can happen is if **all three registers opened before 8:30 am**, and are still serving customers.\n\nBut the first register opened at 8:00 am.\n\nThe second opened as soon as the first became available.\n\nThe third opened as soon as the second became available.\n\nSo for all three to be in use at 8:30 am, the first customer must still be in service at 8:30 am \u2192 so service time > 30 minutes.\n\nBut then Register 2 would open only after the first customer finishes \u2014 so after 8:30 am.\n\nBut then Register 2 would not be in use at 8:30 am.\n\nContradiction.\n\nSo the only way all three registers are in use at 8:30 am is if **each customer takes 15 minutes**, and the registers opened at 8:00, 8:15, 8:30.\n\nLet\u2019s try that.\n\nAssume each customer takes **15 minutes**.\n\n- Register 1: opens at 8:00 am \u2192 serves customer 1 \u2192 finishes at 8:15 am \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:15 am.\n- Register 2: opens at 8:15 am \u2192 serves customer 2 \u2192 finishes at 8:30 am \u2192 Register 3 opens at 8:30 am.\n- Register 3: opens at 8:30 am \u2192 serves customer 3 \u2192 finishes at 8:45 am.\n\nNow, at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: finished at 8:15 am \u2192 free from 8:15 to 8:30 am \u2192 **free** at 8:30 am.\n- Register 2: finishes at 8:30 am \u2192 just becoming free at 8:30 am.\n- Register 3: just opened at 8:30 am \u2192 in use.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free\n- Register 2: just finishing \u2192 free at 8:30 am\n- Register 3: in use\n\nSo **two registers are free** at 8:30 am.\n\nBut the problem says: **all three registers are in use** at 8:30 am.\n\nSo this contradicts.\n\nTherefore, **the only way all three registers are in use at 8:30 am** is if **the first customer took more than 30 minutes**, and the second and third registers opened **before** 8:30 am.\n\nBut that\u2019s impossible unless the first register became free before 8:30 am.\n\nWait \u2014 unless the **first customer started at 8:00 am**, and **took 30 minutes**, so finishes at 8:30 am.\n\nThen:\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:30 \u2192 finishes at 8:30 am \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.\n- Register 2: 8:30\u20139:00 \u2192 finishes at 9:00 am \u2192 Register 3 opens at 9:00 am.\n- Register 3: opens at 9:00 am.\n\nBut at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: just finishing \u2192 free at 8:30 am\n- Register 2: just opening \u2192 in use at 8:30 am\n- Register 3: not open yet\n\nSo only two registers in use at 8:30 am.\n\nStill not three.\n\nSo to have **all three registers in use at 8:30 am**, we need:\n- Register 1: in use at 8:30 am \u2192 so first customer started before 8:30 am and hasn\u2019t finished.\n- Register 2: in use at 8:30 am \u2192 so second customer started before 8:30 am and hasn\u2019t finished.\n- Register 3: in use at 8:30 am \u2192 so third customer started before 8:30 am and hasn\u2019t finished.\n\nBut Register 2 opens when Register 1 becomes free.  \nRegister 3 opens when Register 2 becomes free.\n\nSo for Register 2 to be in use at 8:30 am, it must have opened **before** 8:30 am \u2192 so Register 1 must have become free before 8:30 am.\n\nBut then Register 1 would be free at 8:30 am \u2014 not in use.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, **it is impossible for all three registers to be in use at 8:30 am** if they open sequentially based on the previous register becoming free.\n\nUnless the first customer took **more than 30 minutes**, and the second and third registers opened **before** 8:30 am.\n\nBut that\u2019s impossible.\n\nWait \u2014 unless the **first customer started at 8:00 am**, and took **30 minutes**, so finishes at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nBut then at 8:30 am, Register 1 is free, Register 2 is opening, Register 3 is not open.\n\nSo only one register in use.\n\nNot three.\n\nSo the only way all three are in use at 8:30 am is if **the first customer started at 8:00 am**, and **took 30 minutes**, so finishes at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nBut then Register 2 can\u2019t be in use at 8:30 am unless it started before.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nWait \u2014 unless the **first customer started at 8:00 am**, and **took 45 minutes**, so finishes at 8:45 am.\n\nThen:\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:45 \u2192 in use at 8:30 am\n- Register 2: opens when Register 1 becomes free \u2192 at 8:45 am\n- Register 3: opens when Register 2 becomes free \u2192 at 9:30 am\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: in use\n- Register 2: not open yet\n- Register 3: not open yet\n\nOnly one in use.\n\nNot three.\n\nSo the only way all three are in use at 8:30 am is if **all three registers opened before 8:30 am**, and are still serving.\n\nBut the first opened at 8:00 am.\n\nThe second opened when the first became free.\n\nThe third opened when the second became free.\n\nSo for the second to be open at 8:30 am, the first must have become free before 8:30 am.\n\nBut then the first would be free at 8:30 am \u2014 not in use.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, **it is impossible for all three registers to be in use at 8:30 am** under the given rules.\n\nBut the problem says: \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am...\"\n\nSo we must assume it is possible.\n\nTherefore, the only way is if **each customer takes 15 minutes**, and the registers opened at 8:00, 8:15, 8:30.\n\nThen:\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 free at 8:15\n- Register 2: 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 free at 8:30\n- Register 3: 8:30\u20138:45 \u2192 in use at 8:30\n\nAt 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free\n- Register 2: free\n- Register 3: in use\n\nSo only one in use.\n\nNot three.\n\nWait \u2014 unless the first customer took 30 minutes, so finishes at 8:30 am.\n\nThen:\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:30 \u2192 free at 8:30\n- Register 2: opens at 8:30 \u2192 8:30\u20139:00\n- Register 3: opens at 9:00 \u2192 9:00\u20139:30\n\nAt 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free\n- Register 2: in use\n- Register 3: not open\n\nOnly one in use.\n\nStill not three.\n\nSo the only way all three are in use at 8:30 am is if **the first customer started at 8:00 am**, took 30 minutes, so finishes at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nBut then Register 2 can't be in use at 8:30 am unless it started before.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nUnless the first customer took 45 minutes, so finishes at 8:45 am.\n\nThen:\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:45\n- Register 2: opens at 8:45 \u2192 8:45\u20139:00\n- Register 3: opens at 9:00 \u2192 9:00\u20139:15\n\nAt 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: in use\n- Register 2: not open\n- Register 3: not open\n\nOnly one in use.\n\nSo the only way all three are in use at 8:30 am is if **the first customer started at 8:00 am**, took 30 minutes, so finishes at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nBut then Register 2 can't be in use at 8:30 am.\n\nSo the only way is if the first customer took 30 minutes, so finishes at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nBut then at 8:30 am, Register 1 is free, Register 2 is opening, Register 3 is not open.\n\nSo only one in use.\n\nSo the only way all three are in use at 8:30 am is if **the first customer started at 8:00 am**, took 30 minutes, so finishes at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nBut then Register 2 can't be in use at 8:30 am.\n\nSo the only way is if the first customer took 30 minutes, so finishes at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:30

"Let's solve this step by step.\n\nWe are given a list of three sentences:\n\n1. `'This is an example'`  \n2. `'Sentence two'`  \n3. `'Another one'`\n\nFor each sentence, we need to:\n- Convert the sentence to lowercase (case-insensitive).\n- Count how many **letters** appear **exactly once** in the sentence.\n- Ignore non-letter characters (spaces, punctuation, etc.).\n- Only count alphabetic characters (a\u2013z).\n\nWe\u2019ll process each sentence one by one.\n\n---\n\n### **Sentence 1: \"This is an example\"**\n\nStep 1: Convert to lowercase:  \n`this is an example`\n\nStep 2: Remove non-letters (spaces):  \nLetters: `t h i s i s a n e x a m p l e`\n\nStep 3: Count frequency of each letter:\n\n| Letter | Count |\n|--------|-------|\n| a      | 2     |\n| c      | 1     |\n| e      | 2     |\n| h      | 1     |\n| i      | 2     |\n| l      | 1     |\n| m      | 1     |\n| n      | 1     |\n| p      | 1     |\n| s      | 2     |\n| t      | 1     |\n| x      | 1     |\n\nNow, count how many letters appear **only once**:\n\n- c (1) \u2192 \u2705\n- h (1) \u2192 \u2705\n- l (1) \u2192 \u2705\n- m (1) \u2192 \u2705\n- n (1) \u2192 \u2705\n- p (1) \u2192 \u2705\n- t (1) \u2192 \u2705\n- x (1) \u2192 \u2705\n\nThat\u2019s 8 letters.\n\nSo, **8** letters appear only once.\n\n---\n\n### **Sentence 2: \"Sentence two\"**\n\nStep 1: Lowercase:  \n`sentence two`\n\nStep 2: Extract letters:  \n`s e n t e n c e t w o`\n\nStep 3: Count frequencies:\n\n| Letter | Count |\n|--------|-------|\n| c      | 1     |\n| e      | 3     |\n| n      | 2     |\n| o      | 1     |\n| s      |

It involves weighing personal risk tolerance, financial readiness, market research, long-term goals, and emotional preparedness\u2014factors that vary widely from person to person. A simple yes or no isn\u2019t sufficient; it requires nuanced, personalized advice.\n\n- **Specificity:** The question is **general**. It doesn\u2019t reference a specific industry, business idea, or personal situation (e.g., \u201cShould I start a coffee shop with $10,000 in savings?\u201d). Without context, it\u2019s impossible for a friend to give a meaningful, tailored response.\n\n- **Target Person:** A **friend** is not an expert in entrepreneurship, business planning, or risk assessment. While they may offer emotional support or personal anecdotes, they\u2019re not equipped to provide the detailed, strategic guidance this question demands.\n\n- **Best Venue:** An **online forum** (e.g., Reddit\u2019s r/Entrepreneur, Quora, or a niche business community) is better suited because it allows access to a diverse group of experts, real-world case studies, and structured advice from people with actual experience launching businesses.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Conclusion:** The question is complex and general, and a friend lacks the expertise to address it effectively. An online forum is the better choice."]
