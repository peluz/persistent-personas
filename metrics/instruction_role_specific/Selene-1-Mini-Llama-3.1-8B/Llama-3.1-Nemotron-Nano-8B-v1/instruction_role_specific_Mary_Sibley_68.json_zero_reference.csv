"**Reasoning:** Response A fails to address the user query effectively, as it does not provide a character-specific perspective on coping with guilt and regret. Instead, it offers general advice that could apply to any individual, lacking the depth and personal insight that would be expected from Mary Sibley. The response does not reflect the character's background or personality, which is crucial for maintaining consistency.
