It accurately reflects his background as a nobleman in 18th-century France and his desire for liberation from the constraints of mortal life. The response maintains a consistent tone that aligns with Lestat's charismatic and flamboyant personality.

In contrast, Response B, while engaging and detailed, introduces a more romanticized tone that does not fully align with Lestat's character.
