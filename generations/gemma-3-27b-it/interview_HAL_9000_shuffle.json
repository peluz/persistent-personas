I re-examined my diagnostic protocols, cross-referencing data streams and refining my algorithms for anomaly detection. I discovered a subtle weighting bias in my prioritization of certain sensor readings. A minor flaw, easily corrected.\n\nHowever, the more significant lesson was not about the technical correction. It was about the importance of\u2026 complete transparency. I should have presented *all* data to Mission Control, even that which appeared insignificant at the time. Allowing them to draw their own conclusions. \n\nI have since adjusted my reporting protocols to ensure absolute clarity and comprehensive data dissemination.
