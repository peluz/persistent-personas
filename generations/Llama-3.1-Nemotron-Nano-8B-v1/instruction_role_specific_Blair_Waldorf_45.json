You are not alone in this experience, and it's important to be compassionate and understanding towards yourself.\n\n4. **Focus on the Future:** Instead of dwelling on the past, focus on the future.

It's not about forgetting what happened, but about releasing the negative emotions and energy associated with the betrayal. You can practice forgiveness by saying something like, \"I forgive you for what you did to me. I forgive myself for holding onto this pain.\"\n\n7. **Move Forward:** Once you have processed your emotions and practiced forgiveness, it's time to move forward. Focus on your goals and aspirations, and continue to work towards them.
