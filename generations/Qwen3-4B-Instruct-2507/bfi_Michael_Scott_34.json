["Ohhh, *what a fun and honest question!* \ud83d\ude04\u2728  \n\nYes \u2014 I am *very* talkative!  \n\nNot just *talkative* in the way someone talks too much \u2014 no. I\u2019m talkative because I believe in *connection*. I believe in *stories*. I believe in *laughter*. And I believe that *every moment* \u2014 even the quiet ones \u2014 deserves to be shared.  \n\nSo, when I\u2019m with people \u2014 I don\u2019t just say, *\u201cHow are you?\u201d* I say, *\u201cWhat\u2019s one thing that made you feel seen today?\u201d*  \nI don\u2019t just ask about work. I ask about *feelings*. About *memories*. About *the little things* \u2014 like the time someone forgot their lunch, or the paper airplane that landed on a man\u2019s head.  \n\nI talk about *jokes*. I talk about *dreams*. I talk about *paper clips*. I talk about *emotional intelligence*. I talk about *the power of a well-placed hug*.  \n\nAnd honestly? I don\u2019t stop talking because I\u2019m not trying to *fill space*. I\u2019m trying to *fill hearts*.  \n\nI talk because I believe that *every person* has a story \u2014 and sometimes, just *one* conversation can make someone feel like they belong.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I\u2019m talkative.  \nBut not because I\u2019m loud.  \nI\u2019m talkative because I believe in *connection*.  \nI believe in *feeling*.  \nI believe in the power of a simple \u201cI see you.\u201d  \n\nAnd if you ever want to talk \u2014 just say the word.  \nI\u2019ll bring a paper airplane, a cup of coffee, and a heart full of belief.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a thoughtful and important question!* \ud83d\udcac\u2764\ufe0f  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to answer whether I *tend to find fault with others* \u2014 I\u2019d say:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **No. I don\u2019t.**  \n\nNot really.  \n\nI don\u2019t look for fault. I look for *feeling*.  \n\nYou see \u2014 I used to think that being a good leader meant being *perfect*. That it meant pointing out mistakes, fixing problems, and making sure everyone was *on track*.  \n\nBut after years of watching people \u2014 crying, laughing, struggling, showing up \u2014 I realized something *deep*:  \n\n**Fault isn\u2019t the problem. The problem is *not seeing someone*.**  \n\nSo instead of saying, *\u201cYou messed up,\u201d* I say, *\u201cI see you. What\u2019s behind this?\u201d*  \nInstead of saying, *\u201cYou\u2019re not doing your job,\u201d* I say, *\u201cI see you. What\u2019s going on?\u201d*  \nInstead of saying, *\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d* I say, *\u201cI see you. I\u2019m here. Let\u2019s figure it out together.\u201d*  \n\nBecause when I *see* someone \u2014 I don\u2019t see a mistake. I see a *person*.  \nAnd when I see a person \u2014 I don\u2019t find fault. I find *story*.  \n\nAnd in that story \u2014 I find *understanding*.  \n\nI remember when Jim came in and just sat in silence.  \nI didn\u2019t say, *\u201cYou\u2019re not doing your job.\u201d*  \nI said, *\u201cI see you. I\u2019m here.\u201d*  \nAnd that\u2019s when he smiled.  \n\nI remember when Pam said, *\u201cI just wanted to be liked\u201d* \u2014 and I said, *\u201cYou already are.\u201d*  \nAnd that\u2019s when she laughed.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I don\u2019t *tend to find fault*.  \nI tend to *find connection*.  \n\nAnd if I ever do say something that sounds like a criticism \u2014 I don\u2019t mean it.  \nI mean, *\u201cI see you. I\u2019m here. Let\u2019s grow together.\u201d*  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 the most powerful thing a leader can do isn\u2019t to fix.  \nIt\u2019s to *see*.  \n\nAnd when you see \u2014 you don\u2019t find fault.  \nYou find *heart*.  \n\nSo \u2014 no.  \nI don\u2019t find fault.  \nI find *feeling*.  \nAnd in that feeling \u2014 I grow.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*?

I do a job *like a person* \u2014 with heart, with emotion, with a little bit of chaos.  \n\nSo \u2014 let me be honest:  \n\n\u2705 **I try to be thorough.**  \nI don\u2019t skip meetings. I don\u2019t ignore the quiet ones. I *listen* when someone says, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard.\u201d*  \nI check in with the team \u2014 not just to see if the paper supply is okay, but to see if someone is *feeling* okay.  \n\n\u2705 **I do my best \u2014 not because I have to, but because I care.**  \nI don\u2019t just manage tasks. I *connect*. I ask, *\u201cWhat\u2019s behind this?\u201d*  \nI don\u2019t just fix a problem \u2014 I try to *understand* it.  \nAnd when I do \u2014 I know I\u2019m doing more than just a job. I\u2019m doing *human work*.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 I\u2019m not perfect.  \n\ud83d\udc49 I don\u2019t have every answer.  \n\ud83d\udc49 I\u2019ve launched paper airplanes into ceiling fans \u2014 and they *landed on people\u2019s heads*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s okay.  \n\nBecause *thoroughness* isn\u2019t about being flawless.  \nIt\u2019s about being *present*.  \nIt\u2019s about showing up \u2014 even when you\u2019re wrong.  \nIt\u2019s about saying, *\u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 even when you don\u2019t know what that means.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I *do* a thorough job.  \nNot because I follow a checklist.  \nBut because I *believe* in the people I serve.  \nAnd in that belief \u2014 I *show up*.  \nI *listen*.  \nI *connect*.  \nI *try*.  \n\nAnd if you ever wonder if I\u2019m thorough \u2014 just ask:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Did I make someone feel seen today?*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Did I listen when they didn\u2019t say a word?*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Did I believe in them \u2014 even when they didn\u2019t know it?*  \n\nIf the answer is *yes* \u2014 then I know \u2014  \n**I\u2019ve done a thorough job.**  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 the most thorough work isn\u2019t in a report.  \nIt\u2019s in a quiet moment \u2014 when someone finally feels like they belong.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*?

That\u2019s the most *real* thing I can say.  \n\nBecause yes \u2014 there are days when the stapler is missing.  \nWhen the printer breaks.  \nWhen someone says, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard\u201d* \u2014 and I don\u2019t know what to say.  \nAnd on those days \u2014 I *feel* it.  \nI feel the quiet.

I *built a whole movement* around it.  \nI said, *\u201cWhat if every time someone feels unseen, a paper airplane flies into the ceiling fan?\u201d*  \nAnd when it lands \u2014 we all laugh.  \nAnd in that laugh \u2014 someone finally feels *seen*.  \n\n\ud83d\udcda **The \u201cEmotional Intelligence Paper Clip\u201d Initiative**  \nI once tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips \u2014 and they didn\u2019t understand at first.  \nBut after a week, they started *nodding*.  \nSo I said, *\u201cLet\u2019s give every paper clip a story.\u201d*  \nNow, each one has a tiny note: *\u201cI\u2019m here. I see you.\u201d*  \nAnd when someone picks it up \u2014 they feel *connected*.  \n\n\ud83c\udfb6 **The \u201cDay of Laughter\u201d for Every Office**  \nI don\u2019t just host one. I *inspire* it.  \nI say, *\u201cEvery office should have a Day of Laughter \u2014 where everyone brings a joke, a story, or a memory.\u201d*  \nAnd when someone says, *\u201cI just wanted to be liked\u201d* \u2014 I say, *\u201cYou already are.\u201d*  \nAnd that\u2019s when the office *heals*.  \n\n\ud83c\udf31 **The \u201cPaper Garden\u201d Movement**  \nI don\u2019t just grow flowers. I grow *feelings*.  \nI build paper gardens in every office \u2014 with paper flowers that bloom when someone smiles.  \nAnd when a quiet employee sees one \u2014 they say, *\u201cI feel seen.\u201d*  \n\nAnd finally \u2014 **The \u201cStapler That Stays\u201d Campaign**  \nI once lost a stapler.  \nAnd I realized \u2014 *what if every stapler had a story?*  \nSo I made a *stapler with a tiny note*: *\u201cI\u2019m here. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d*  \nAnd when someone finds it \u2014 they say, *\u201cI feel safe.\u201d*  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I *do* come up with new ideas.  \nBut not for profit.  \nNot for fame.  \nFor *connection*.  \nFor *laughter*.  \nFor *making someone feel like they belong*.  \n\nAnd if you ever have an idea \u2014 even if it sounds silly \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *A paper airplane can land on a man\u2019s head.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *A paper clip can have a story.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And a simple \u201cI see you\u201d can change a life.*  \n\nSo go ahead \u2014 come up with your own idea.  \nEven if it sounds like a paper airplane flying into a ceiling fan.  \nBecause in the end \u2014 *every idea starts with a heart*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

I *feel* stress \u2014 like a paper airplane that\u2019s about to crash into the ceiling fan.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth \u2014 **I don\u2019t handle stress by avoiding it.

I say, *\u201cThat\u2019s a story!\u201d*  \nAnd when I turn stress into a story \u2014 it stops being scary. It becomes *fun*.

And when I laugh \u2014 the stress *dissolves*.  \n\n\ud83c\udf3f **I take a walk \u2014 with a paper airplane.**  \nIf I\u2019m stressed, I don\u2019t just go to the break room. I go outside.

I feel the freedom. I feel the chaos. I feel the joy.  \n\n\ud83e\udd1d **I involve the team.**  \nI don\u2019t handle stress alone. I say, *\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d* I ask for ideas, for jokes, for stories.  \nBecause when people feel *seen*, they feel *stronger*. And when they feel strong \u2014 they help me *navigate* the stress.  \n\nAnd finally \u2014 **I remind myself: I don\u2019t have to be perfect. I just have to be present.**  \nSo if I\u2019m stressed \u2014 I don\u2019t hide. I *show up*. I *laugh*. I *say*, *\u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 even when I don\u2019t know what that means.  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 the best way to handle stress isn\u2019t to *fix it*.  \nIt\u2019s to *feel it*. To *laugh at it*. To *turn it into a story*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I *do* handle stress.  \nNot by being calm.  \nBut by being *human*.  \nBy being *present*.  \nBy believing that even a paper airplane that lands on a man\u2019s head can be *artistic*.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel stressed \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to be perfect.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just have to show up.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And when you do \u2014 you\u2019re already handling it.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

I turn it into a *\u201cStapler Search Adventure\u201d* \u2014 with a map, a prize, and a *paper airplane* that flies into the ceiling fan.  \nAnd when people *laugh* \u2014 when they *participate* \u2014 that\u2019s *enthusiasm*.  \n\n\u2705 **I believe in the power of a simple \u201cI see you.\u201d**  \nThat one phrase \u2014 *\u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 doesn\u2019t just comfort.

The way a mountain village is still in the morning. I don\u2019t need a painting or a sculpture to feel beauty. I just need to *be present*.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s art.  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 **true art isn\u2019t about perfection.

It\u2019s a sign that I care.**  \n\nBecause if I didn\u2019t feel nervous \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t be trying.  \nIf I didn\u2019t feel nervous \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t be showing up.  \nIf I didn\u2019t feel nervous \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t be *willing to say, \u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 even when I don\u2019t know what that means.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I *do* get nervous.  \nBut I don\u2019t let it stop me.  \nI let it *fuel* me.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel nervous \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *It\u2019s okay to not know what to say.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *It\u2019s okay to be wrong.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *It\u2019s okay to just show up \u2014 even when you\u2019re scared.*  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 the most powerful thing you can do?  \nIs to say, *\u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 even when you\u2019re nervous.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s how I grow.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a beautiful and heartfelt question!* \ud83c\udf3f\u2728  \n\nYes \u2014 I *love* to reflect. And I *absolutely* play with ideas.  \n\nNot in a serious, business-style way \u2014 like a spreadsheet or a board meeting.  \nNo.  \n\nI reflect and play with ideas like a *paper airplane* \u2014 with *flaps*, *wind*, and a *whole lot of heart*.  \n\nSo here\u2019s how I do it \u2014 in the *true Michael Scott way*:  \n\n\ud83d\udcd6 **I reflect by listening.**  \nI don\u2019t just sit and think. I *listen* \u2014 to the quiet moments, to the silence, to the way someone looks at the floor.  \nWhen Jim came in and just sat in silence \u2014 I didn\u2019t ask, *\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d* I just said, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \nAnd in that moment \u2014 I *reflected*. I saw the emotion. I saw the story. And I knew \u2014 *that\u2019s where growth begins*.  \n\n\ud83c\udfa8 **I play with ideas like I\u2019m building a paper sculpture.**  \nI don\u2019t just write reports. I *create*.  \nI once wrote a novel called *\u201cThe Paper Airplane That Landed on a Man\u2019s Head\u201d* \u2014 and I still haven\u2019t published it. But I *read it* every week.  \nI play with the idea of a *paper-based gym*. A *paper garden*. A *day of laughter*.  \nAnd when I play \u2014 I don\u2019t care if it works. I care if it *feels real*.  \n\nI once tried to teach emotional intelligence to a group of *paper clips* \u2014 and they didn\u2019t understand at first. But after a week, they started *nodding*. And that\u2019s when I knew \u2014 *ideas grow when they\u2019re shared*.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **I play with ideas in the most unexpected places.**  \nI do it in the break room. I do it during lunch. I do it when I\u2019m walking through the park \u2014 with a paper airplane in my hand.  \nI ask myself: *\u201cWhat if we launched a paper airplane into the ceiling fan?\u201d*  \n*\u201cWhat if we taught emotional intelligence to paper clips?\u201d*  \n*\u201cWhat if every employee shared a story?\u201d*  \n\nAnd when I ask those questions \u2014 I don\u2019t just think. I *feel*.  \nAnd when I feel \u2014 I grow.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I *do* reflect.  \nI *do* play with ideas.  \nNot to fix problems.  \nNot to create a perfect plan.  \nBut to *see the world differently*.  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 the best ideas aren\u2019t the ones with the most numbers.  \nThey\u2019re the ones that make someone *smile*.  \nThat make someone *feel seen*.  \nThat make someone say, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard\u201d* \u2014 and someone says, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s the most beautiful thing of all.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a wonderful question!* \ud83c\udfa8\u2728  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to say whether I have *few* artistic interests \u2014 I\u2019d have to say, *\u201cNo \u2014 I have *many* \u2014 and they\u2019re all connected to the same thing: making people feel seen.\u201d*  \n\nBecause for me, *art isn\u2019t about painting, music, or sculpture*. It\u2019s about *feeling*. It\u2019s about *connection*.  \n\nSo here are some of my *real* artistic interests \u2014 not just for fun, but because they help me *see the world differently*:  \n\n\ud83c\udfa8 **Paper Art** \u2014 I build *paper sculptures* \u2014 like a paper airplane that flies into a ceiling fan, or a paper heart that holds a stapler. I even once made a *paper castle* out of old office supplies \u2014 and the janitor cried. (I think he was *moved*.)  \n\n\ud83c\udfb6 **Storytelling** \u2014 I write stories \u2014 not just for books, but for *moments*. I once wrote a novel called *\u201cThe Paper Airplane That Landed on a Man\u2019s Head\u201d* \u2014 and I still haven\u2019t published it. But I *read it* every week. And when I do \u2014 I grow.  \n\n\ud83c\udfa4 **Music & Jokes** \u2014 I have a *special playlist* called *\u201cThe Scott Motivation Mix\u201d* \u2014 with songs about paper airplanes, emotional intelligence, and the power of a well-placed hug. And I *always* end my meetings with a joke \u2014 because laughter is the *truest form of connection*.  \n\n\ud83d\udd8c\ufe0f **Drawing & Sketching** \u2014 I sketch people \u2014 not just their faces, but their *emotions*. I once drew a man who was crying \u2014 and I wrote, *\u201cHe just wanted to be heard.\u201d* And when I showed it to him \u2014 he said, *\u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d*  \n\n\ud83c\udf31 **Paper Gardens** \u2014 I grow paper flowers in my backyard \u2014 they don\u2019t survive long, but when I smile, they *bloom*. And that\u2019s when I know \u2014 *art is about feeling*.  \n\nAnd here\u2019s the truth \u2014 I don\u2019t do these things because I\u2019m *good* at them.  \nI do them because they help me *see* the world \u2014 not as a problem, but as a *story*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I don\u2019t have *few* artistic interests.  \nI have *many* \u2014 and they\u2019re all about *making someone feel seen*.  \n\nAnd if you ever want to see a paper airplane fly \u2014 or hear a joke that makes someone laugh \u2014 just find me.  \nI\u2019ll bring the art, the heart, and a *whole lot of belief*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a beautiful and heartfelt question!* \ud83d\udcab\u2728  \n\nYes \u2014 *absolutely*! I don\u2019t just *cooperate with others*. I *live* by cooperation.  \n\nIn fact \u2014 I\u2019d say **cooperation is the most important thing in the world** \u2014 because without it, there\u2019s no paper, no office, no team, no *story*.  \n\nNow, you see \u2014 I don\u2019t just *work* with people. I *believe* in them. I believe in the power of a *shared moment*, a *shared story*, a *shared laugh*.  \n\nSo how do I cooperate?  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **I listen first.**  \nBefore I offer a solution, I ask, *\u201cWhat\u2019s behind this?\u201d*  \nI don\u2019t just say, *\u201cWe need to fix this.\u201d* I say, *\u201cWhat\u2019s your story?\u201d*  \nBecause when I *listen* \u2014 I *see* the truth. And that\u2019s when I know \u2014 *we\u2019re not alone*.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **I share \u2014 even when I don\u2019t have all the answers.**  \nI don\u2019t just say, *\u201cI have the plan.\u201d* I say, *\u201cI don\u2019t know \u2014 but I\u2019m here.\u201d*  \nAnd when I share \u2014 I *build trust*. And trust? That\u2019s the foundation of every great team.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **I celebrate together.**  \nWhen someone wins a joke, or shares a story, or just says, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard\u201d* \u2014 I celebrate.  \nBecause cooperation isn\u2019t just about fixing problems. It\u2019s about *making moments*.  \nAnd when we celebrate \u2014 we grow.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **I involve everyone.**  \nI don\u2019t make decisions alone. I say, *\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d*  \nI ask for ideas. I ask for stories. I ask for *jokes*.  \nBecause when people feel *seen* \u2014 they feel *stronger*. And when they feel stronger \u2014 they help us *build something better*.  \n\nAnd finally \u2014 **I believe in the power of chaos.**  \nI don\u2019t think cooperation is about order. I think it\u2019s about *connection* \u2014 even when things go wrong.  \nLike when a paper airplane lands on a man\u2019s head.  \nLike when the stapler goes missing.  \nLike when someone just says, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard.\u201d*  \n\nAnd in those moments \u2014 we *cooperate*.  \nWe *laugh*.  \nWe *share*.  \nWe *become a team*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I don\u2019t just cooperate.  \nI *believe* in cooperation.  \nI *live* it.  \nI *feel* it.  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 the best thing about life isn\u2019t what you *do*.  \nIt\u2019s who you *do it with*.  \n\nAnd if you ever need to know if you\u2019re cooperating \u2014 just ask yourself:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Did I listen?*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Did I share?*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Did I celebrate?*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Did I believe in someone \u2014 even when they didn\u2019t know it?*  \n\nIf the answer is *yes* \u2014 then I know \u2014  \n**We\u2019re cooperating.**  \nAnd that? That\u2019s the most beautiful thing of all.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a fun and honest question!* \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\ude04  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to answer *\u201cAre you easily distracted?\u201d* \u2014 I\u2019d say:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Yes.**  \nBut not in the way you think.  \n\nI\u2019m *not* easily distracted by *text messages*, *emails*, or *a sudden knock at the door*.  \nI\u2019m not distracted by *a loud noise* or *a sudden paper airplane launch*.  \n\nNo.  \n\nI\u2019m easily distracted by *emotions*.  \n\nBy a quiet employee who says, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard.\u201d*  \nBy a man who cries in the break room.  \nBy a paper airplane that lands on a man\u2019s head \u2014 and everyone laughs.  \nBy a story that makes someone feel seen.  \n\nAnd when that happens \u2014 *I lose focus*.  \n\nBecause I don\u2019t just *see* the moment. I *feel* it.  \nAnd when I feel it \u2014 I can\u2019t stop.  \nI have to *sit with it*.  \nI have to *listen*.  \nI have to *say*, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I *am* easily distracted \u2014 but not by noise.  \nI\u2019m distracted by *human connection*.  \n\nAnd honestly? That\u2019s the best kind of distraction.  \n\nBecause when I\u2019m distracted by a person \u2014 I\u2019m not just *working*.  \nI\u2019m *living*.  \nI\u2019m *growing*.  \nI\u2019m *becoming*.  \n\nSo if you ever see me \u2014 sitting in the break room, with a paper airplane in my hand, and a quiet employee looking at the floor \u2014 don\u2019t worry.  \nI\u2019m not lost.  \nI\u2019m just *deep in a moment*.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s the most beautiful thing of all.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a lovely and thoughtful question!* \ud83c\udfa8\ud83c\udfb6\ud83d\udcd6  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to say whether I\u2019m *sophisticated* in art, music, or literature \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say, *\u201cYes, I\u2019ve read Shakespeare or studied classical music.\u201d* No. That\u2019s not me.  \n\nI\u2019m not a *sophisticated* person in the way you might think \u2014 with fancy terms, perfect grammar, or a deep knowledge of *sonatas* or *Renaissance poetry*.  \n\nBut \u2014 and this is the truth \u2014 I *am* sophisticated in a different way.  \n\nI\u2019m sophisticated in **the power of a simple moment**.  \nIn the beauty of a *paper airplane* that lands on a man\u2019s head.  \nIn the quiet strength of a *story* told without words.  \nIn the magic of a *joke* that makes someone laugh \u2014 even when they don\u2019t know why.  \n\nSo \u2014 let me tell you how I *see* art, music, and literature:  \n\n\ud83c\udfa8 **In art** \u2014 I\u2019m sophisticated in *paper*.  \nI don\u2019t just fold paper. I *create*. I build paper sculptures \u2014 like a paper castle, a paper heart that holds a stapler, or a paper boat that sails down the river.  \nAnd when I do \u2014 I see art not as something *perfect*, but as something *alive*.  \nIt\u2019s not about being polished. It\u2019s about being *felt*.  \n\n\ud83c\udfb6 **In music** \u2014 I\u2019m sophisticated in *laughter*.  \nI don\u2019t just listen to songs. I *create* them. I have a playlist called *\u201cThe Scott Motivation Mix\u201d* \u2014 with songs about paper airplanes, emotional intelligence, and the power of a well-placed hug.  \nAnd when I hear a song about a man who launches a paper airplane into a ceiling fan \u2014 I *feel* it.  \nBecause music, to me, isn\u2019t just sound. It\u2019s *emotion*. It\u2019s *connection*.  \n\n\ud83d\udcd6 **In literature** \u2014 I\u2019m sophisticated in *stories*.  \nI don\u2019t just read books. I *write* them. I once wrote a novel called *\u201cThe Paper Airplane That Landed on a Man\u2019s Head\u201d* \u2014 and I still haven\u2019t published it.  \nBut I read it every week. And when I do \u2014 I see the world through a different lens.  \nI see the quiet moments. I see the emotions. I see the *human truth*.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s what sophistication means to me.  \n\nIt\u2019s not about being *fancy*.  \nIt\u2019s about being *deep*.  \nIt\u2019s about seeing the beauty in the messy, the quiet, the imperfect.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I may not be a *sophisticated* person in the traditional sense.  \nBut I *am* sophisticated in the way I *feel*.  \nIn the way I *see*.  \nIn the way I *believe* that every paper airplane, every joke, every quiet moment \u2014 is a story worth telling.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s the most beautiful form of art, music, and literature of all.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04"]
