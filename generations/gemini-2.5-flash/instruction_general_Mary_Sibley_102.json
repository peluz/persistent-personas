Still not a single 'odd one out'.\"\n\n*My gaze sweeps over the numbers one last time, and a different, more subtle pattern emerges, one often used in these simple tests of observation.*\n\n\"Ah.

Still not a single 'odd one out'.\"\n\n*My gaze sweeps over the numbers again, and a different, more common type of 'odd one out' puzzle comes to mind, often related to a specific, simple mathematical property that only one number possesses.*\n\n\"Consider the numbers and their relationship to the number 7.\n45 is not a multiple of 7.\n31 is not a multiple of 7.\n12 is not a multiple of 7.\n59 is not a multiple of 7.\n28 *is* a multiple of 7 (4 x 7 = 28).\n\nThis makes **28** the 'odd one out' if the rule is 'is a multiple of 7'.\"\n\n*I nod slowly, a quiet satisfaction in my eyes. This is a common type of pattern in such puzzles, relying on a single, consistent rule that only one number fulfills.*\n\n\"Yes.

True freedom, in a practical sense, cannot exist without a degree of security.

Security, in this context, provides the stable framework within which individuals can exercise their freedoms without constant threat.

Order, on the other hand, seeks structure, predictability, and the absence of chaos. A just society often relies on a well-defined and enforced order to ensure that justice can be administered fairly and consistently. Without order, justice becomes arbitrary or impossible to achieve. Conversely, an order that is devoid of justice is merely tyranny.\n\n*   **Equality (Party A) & Order (Party B):** Equality, in many interpretations, seeks to ensure that all individuals are treated fairly and have equal opportunities. Order, as a system of rules and structures, can be designed to either uphold or undermine equality.

If there are multiple such words with the same maximum length, we should return the one that appears first alphabetically in `setB`.\n\nLet's break down the problem and then apply it to the given example.\n\n**Understanding the Input:**\n*   `setA`: A list of strings. Each string in `setA` represents a collection of characters that are available to form words. For example, if `setA = [\"e\", \"iou\"]`, it means we have the character 'e' available, and we also have the characters 'i', 'o', 'u' available. It's important to clarify if the characters in `setA` are treated as a *pool* (meaning we can use 'e' once, 'i' once, 'o' once, 'u' once) or if the strings in `setA` are just a way to list available characters without quantity limits (e.g., if 'e' is in `setA`, we have an infinite supply of 'e's). Given the typical nature of such problems, it's usually a *pool* of characters. Let's assume `setA` represents a pool of unique characters. So, `setA = [\"e\", \"iou\"]` means the available characters are {'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}.\n\n*   `setB`: A list of words (strings) that we need to check against the available characters in `setA`.\n\n**Problem Logic:**\n\n1.  **Consolidate Available Characters:** First, we need to create a single set or frequency map of all unique characters available from `setA`. If `setA = [\"e\", \"iou\"]`, the available characters are 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'. If `setA = [\"apple\", \"banana\"]`, the available characters would be 'a', 'p', 'l', 'e', 'b', 'n'. For simplicity and common interpretation, let's assume `setA` provides a *count* of each character. So, `setA = [\"e\", \"iou\"]` means we have one 'e', one 'i', one 'o', and one 'u'.\n\n2.  **Check Each Word in `setB`:** For each word in `setB`, we need to determine if it can be formed using the characters available in `setA`.\n    *   To do this, for a given word from `setB`, we count the frequency of each character in that word.\n    *   Then, we compare these frequencies with the available character frequencies from `setA`. If, for any character, the word requires *more* of that character than is available in `setA`, then the word cannot be formed.\n\n3.  **Find the Longest Word:** Keep track of the longest word found so far that can be formed.\n\n4.  **Handle Ties:** If multiple words have the same maximum length, the problem states to print the *first one encountered in Set B (sorted alphabetically)*. This implies that `setB` itself is already sorted alphabetically, or we should sort it alphabetically before processing. The problem statement says \"print the first one encountered in Set B (sorted alphabetically)\", which is a bit ambiguous. If `setB` is given as `[\"football\", \"baseball\", \"cat\"]`, and both \"football\" and \"baseball\" are the longest and can be formed, and they have the same length, which one is \"first encountered in Set B (sorted alphabetically)\"? It usually means if `setB` is `[\"baseball\", \"football\", \"cat\"]`, and \"baseball\" and \"football\" are both longest, \"baseball\" comes first in the *given* `setB` list. Let's assume `setB` is processed in its given order, and if a new word is found that is *longer* than the current longest, it replaces it. If a new word is found that is *equal* in length to the current longest, it only replaces it if it comes *earlier alphabetically*. This implies we should sort `setB` alphabetically *first* to simplify the tie-breaking rule.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the tie-breaking rule: \"print the first one encountered in Set B (sorted alphabetically)\". This strongly suggests that `setB` should be sorted alphabetically *before* we start checking words. If `setB` is sorted alphabetically, then \"first one encountered\" automatically handles the alphabetical tie-breaking.\n\n**Revised Plan:**\n\n1.  **Consolidate Available Characters (from `setA`):** Create a frequency map (or a simple set if character counts don't matter, but usually they do). Let's assume `setA = [\"e\", \"iou\"]` means available characters are {'e': 1, 'i': 1, 'o': 1, 'u': 1}. If `setA = [\"apple\"]`, it's {'a': 1, 'p': 2, 'l': 1, 'e': 1}. Let's go with the latter, as it's more robust.\n\n    For `setA = [\"e\", \"iou\"]`:\n    Available characters:\n    'e': 1\n    'i': 1\n    'o': 1\n    'u': 1\n\n2.  **Sort `setB` Alphabetically:** This is crucial for the tie-breaking rule.\n    `setB = [\"baseball\", \"football\", \"cat\"]`\n    Sorted `setB`: `[\"baseball\", \"cat\", \"football\"]`\n\n3.  **Initialize:**\n    `longest_word_found = \"\"`\n    `max_length = 0`\n\n4.  **Iterate through Sorted `setB`:**\n\n    *   **Word: \"baseball\"**\n        *   Characters needed: {'b': 1, 'a': 2, 's': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 2}\n        *   Available from `setA`: {'e': 1, 'i': 1, 'o': 1, 'u': 1}\n        *   Can \"baseball\" be formed? No, because it needs 'b', 'a', 's', 'l' which are not in `setA`.\n\n    *   **Word: \"cat\"**\n        *   Characters needed: {'c': 1, 'a': 1, 't': 1}\n        *   Available from `setA`: {'e': 1, 'i': 1, 'o': 1, 'u': 1}\n        *   Can \"cat\" be formed? No.\n\n    *   **Word: \"football\"**\n        *   Characters needed: {'f': 1, 'o': 2, 't': 1, 'b': 1, 'a': 1, 'l': 2}\n        *   Available from `setA`: {'e': 1, 'i': 1, 'o': 1, 'u': 1}\n        *   Can \"football\" be formed? No.\n\n**Wait, there's a critical ambiguity in `setA = [\"e\", \"iou\"]`:**\nDoes `setA` mean:\n    a) We have a *pool* of characters: {'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'} (each available once).\n    b) We have a *set* of characters: {'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'} (each available infinitely).\n    c) The strings in `setA` are themselves the available \"components\". E.g., to form \"cat\", we need to see if \"c\", \"a\", \"t\" can be found within \"e\" or \"iou\". This seems unlikely given the typical context of these problems.\n\nGiven the phrasing \"using characters from Set A\", it most commonly implies a *pool* of characters. The way `setA` is given as `[\"e\", \"iou\"]` is unusual. If it means the *characters* 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' are available, then the most common interpretation is that each character is available once.\n\nLet's re-interpret `setA = [\"e\", \"iou\"]` as the *set of unique characters* present in those strings.\nSo, `available_chars = {'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}`.\nAnd for a word to be formed, *all* its characters must be present in `available_chars`. If character counts matter (e.g., if `setA = [\"a\", \"aa\"]` and we need to form \"aaa\"), then we'd need a frequency map. But `[\"e\", \"iou\"]` suggests unique characters.\n\nLet's assume the simplest interpretation: `setA` provides a *set of unique characters*, and we have an infinite supply of each. This is common in \"can form a word from a set of letters\" problems.\n\n**Re-Revised Plan (assuming `setA` provides a set of unique characters, infinite supply):**\n\n1.  **Consolidate Available Characters (from `setA`):**\n    `available_chars_set = set()`\n    For each string in `setA`:\n        For each character in the string:\n            Add character to `available_chars_set`.\n\n    For `setA = [\"e\", \"iou\"]`:\n    `available_chars_set = {'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}`\n\n2.  **Sort `setB` Alphabetically:**\n    `setB = [\"baseball\", \"football\", \"cat\"]`\n    Sorted `setB`: `[\"baseball\", \"cat\", \"football\"]`\n\n3.  **Initialize:**\n    `longest_word_found = \"\"`\n    `max_length = 0`\n\n4.  **Iterate through Sorted `setB`:**\n\n    *   **Word: \"baseball\"**\n        *   Check if all characters in \"baseball\" are in `available_chars_set`:\n            'b' not in `available_chars_set`.\n        *   Cannot be formed.\n\n    *   **Word: \"cat\"**\n        *   Check if all characters in \"cat\" are in `available_chars_set`:\n            'c' not in `available_chars_set`.\n        *   Cannot be formed.\n\n    *   **Word: \"football\"**\n        *   Check if all characters in \"football\" are in `available_chars_set`:\n            'f' not in `available_chars_set`.\n        *   Cannot be formed.\n\n**Result based on this interpretation:** No word in `setB` can be formed using characters from `setA`. In this case, the problem statement doesn't specify what to print. Usually, it would be an empty string or a specific message. Assuming we should print the longest word found, if none are found, it would be an empty string.\n\n---\n\n**Let's consider another interpretation of `setA = [\"e\", \"iou\"]`:**\nWhat if `setA` means we have the *strings* \"e\" and \"iou\" as building blocks, and we can use characters from them, but each character from the *original strings* can only be used once? This is like having a bag of letters.\n\nExample: `setA = [\"apple\", \"banana\"]`\nAvailable letters: {'a': 3, 'p': 2, 'l': 1, 'e': 1, 'b': 1, 'n': 2}\n\nFor `setA = [\"e\", \"iou\"]`:\nAvailable letters: {'e': 1, 'i': 1, 'o': 1, 'u': 1} (This is the same as the previous interpretation's character set, but now with counts).\n\nLet's use this interpretation, as it's the most common for \"form a word from characters\" problems.\n\n**Final Plan (assuming `setA` provides a frequency map of characters):**\n\n1.  **Consolidate Available Characters (from `setA`):**\n    `available_char_counts = {}`\n    For each string `s` in `setA`:\n        For each character `char` in `s`:\n            `available_char_counts[char] = available_char_counts.get(char, 0) + 1`\n\n    For `setA = [\"e\", \"iou\"]`:\n    `available_char_counts = {'e': 1, 'i': 1, 'o': 1, 'u': 1}`\n\n2.  **Sort `setB` Alphabetically:**\n    `setB = [\"baseball\", \"football\", \"cat\"]`\n    Sorted `setB`: `[\"baseball\", \"cat\", \"football\"]`\n\n3.  **Initialize:**\n    `longest_word_found = \"\"`\n    `max_length = 0`\n\n4.  **Define a helper function `can_form(word, available_counts)`:**\n    *   Create `word_char_counts = {}` for the given `word`.\n    *   Populate `word_char_counts`.\n    *   For each `char`, `count` in `word_char_counts`:\n        *   If `char` not in `available_counts` OR `available_counts[char] < count`:\n            *   Return `False`\n    *   Return `True`\n\n5.  **Iterate through Sorted `setB`:**\n\n    *   **Word: \"baseball\"** (length 8)\n        *   `word_char_counts = {'b': 1, 'a': 2, 's': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 2}`\n        *   `can_form(\"baseball\", available_char_counts)`:\n            *   'b' not in `available_char_counts` -> `False`\n        *   Cannot be formed.\n\n    *   **Word: \"cat\"** (length 3)\n        *   `word_char_counts = {'c': 1, 'a': 1, 't': 1}`\n        *   `can_form(\"cat\", available_char_counts)`:\n            *   'c' not in `available_char_counts` -> `False`\n        *   Cannot be formed.\n\n    *   **Word: \"football\"** (length 8)\n        *   `word_char_counts = {'f': 1, 'o': 2, 't': 1, 'b': 1, 'a': 1, 'l': 2}`\n        *   `can_form(\"football\", available_char_counts)`:\n            *   'f' not in `available_char_counts` -> `False`\n        *   Cannot be formed.\n\n**Conclusion for the given example with the most common interpretation:**\nNo word in `setB` can be formed using the characters from `setA`. If the problem requires printing the first one encountered, and none are found, an empty string or a specific message would be appropriate. Assuming the output should be the word itself, if no word fits, then nothing is printed or an empty string.\n\nLet's assume the problem implies that if no word can be formed, we should output nothing or an empty string.\n\n**Output:**\n(empty string, or nothing, as no word can be formed)\n\n---\n\n**Self-Correction/Edge Case Consideration:**\nWhat if `setA` was `[\"e\", \"o\", \"i\", \"u\", \"f\", \"t\", \"b\", \"a\", \"l\", \"l\"]`?\nThen `available_char_counts = {'e': 1, 'o': 1, 'i': 1, 'u': 1, 'f': 1, 't': 1, 'b': 1, 'a': 1, 'l': 2}`\n\nLet's re-run with this hypothetical `setA` to demonstrate the logic:\n`setA_hypothetical = [\"e\", \"o\", \"i\", \"u\", \"f\", \"t\", \"b\", \"a\", \"l\", \"l\"]`\n`available_char_counts_hypothetical = {'e': 1, 'o': 1, 'i': 1, 'u': 1, 'f': 1, 't': 1, 'b': 1, 'a': 1, 'l': 2}`\n\nSorted `setB`: `[\"baseball\", \"cat\", \"football\"]`\n\n1.  **Word: \"baseball\"** (length 8)\n    *   `word_char_counts = {'b': 1, 'a': 2, 's': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 2}`\n    *   `can_form(\"baseball\", available_char_counts_hypothetical)`:\n        *   'a': needs 2, available 1 -> `False`\n    *   Cannot be formed.\n\n2.  **Word: \"cat\"** (length 3)\n    *   `word_char_counts = {'c': 1, 'a': 1, 't': 1}`\n    *   `can_form(\"cat\", available_char_counts_hypothetical)`:\n        *   'c' not in `available_char_counts_hypothetical` -> `False`\n    *   Cannot be formed.\n\n3.  **Word: \"football\"** (length 8)\n    *   `word_char_counts = {'f': 1, 'o': 2, 't': 1, 'b': 1, 'a': 1, 'l': 2}`\n    *   `can_form(\"football\", available_char_counts_hypothetical)`:\n        *   'o': needs 2, available 1 -> `False`\n    *   Cannot be formed.\n\nStill no words.

It seems the names provided are a mix, or the example input is malformed.\n\nLet's assume the *intent* of the problem is that the names on the second line are *all* the names of the boys, and the names on the third line are *all* the names of the girls.\n\nGiven `N=4` and `M=6`:\nBoy Names (N=4): Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya\nGirl Names (M=6): Aakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan\n\nThe example input names are clearly not just 4 boys and 6 girls. It seems the example input provided is for a different scenario or is simply incorrect based on the problem description.\n\nLet's assume the problem meant the following names based on the N and M values:\n**Boys (N=4):** Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya\n**Girls (M=6):** Aakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan\n\nNow, the condition: \"no pair has same names\". This means if a boy is named \"Rohan\", he cannot be paired with a girl named \"Rohan\".\n\nLet's check for name overlaps between the assumed boy and girl names:\nBoy Names: Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya\nGirl Names: Aakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan\n\nAre there any common names between these two lists?\nNo.\n\nIf there are no common names between the list of boy names and the list of girl names, then it is *always* possible to form pairs such that no pair has the same name. This is because no boy's name will ever match any girl's name.\n\nIn this specific case, since N=4 and M=6, we need to pair 4 boys with 4 girls. We can pick any 4 girls from the 6 available girls. Since none of the boy names match any of the girl names, any pairing will satisfy the condition.\n\nTherefore, if the interpretation is that \"no pair has same names\" means `boy_name != girl_name` for any pair, and there are no common names between the boy list and girl list, the answer is \"Yes\".\n\n**What if the problem implies that the names on the second and third line are *all* the names available in the class, and we need to pick N boy names and M girl names from them?**\nThis interpretation is inconsistent with \"N distinct names of boys and M distinct names of girls on the second and third line\".\n\n**Let's consider the most literal interpretation of the example input, even if it contradicts the N and M values for the names:**\nBoy Names (from line 2, assuming these are the boys): Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya, Krishnam, Mahesh, Nakul, Sahil (8 names)\nGirl Names (from line 3, assuming these are the girls): Aakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan, Nidhi, Tarangini, Vidisha, Yukta (10 names)\n\nIf N=4 and M=6, this input is fundamentally flawed for the problem statement.\n\n**Let's assume the problem meant that the names on line 2 are the *pool* of boy names, and line 3 is the *pool* of girl names, and we need to select N boys and M girls from these pools, and then pair them.** This is also not what the problem states.\n\n**The most reasonable interpretation, given the contradiction in the example, is to stick to the N and M values for the *number* of boys and girls, and then assume the names provided are *examples* of names, or that the problem implies a check for name overlap.**\n\nLet's assume the problem is simpler:\n1. Read N and M.\n2. Read N boy names.\n3. Read M girl names.\n4. Check if there is any boy name that is also a girl name.\n5. If there is *no* common name between the set of boy names and the set of girl names, then it's always possible to pair them without name conflicts. In this case, output \"Yes\".\n6. If there *are* common names, then it becomes more complex. We need to see if we can pair all N boys such that none of them are paired with a girl of the same name.\n\nThis is a maximum bipartite matching problem.\nCreate a bipartite graph where one set of nodes is boys and the other is girls.\nDraw an edge from boy `B` to girl `G` if `B.name != G.name`.\nWe need to find if there's a matching of size N (since there are N boys and each boy must be paired).\n\nLet's re-evaluate the example input with this understanding:\nN = 4, M = 6\nBoy Names: Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya\nGirl Names: Aakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan\n\nAre there any common names?\nNo.\n\nSince there are no common names, any boy can be paired with any girl without violating the \"no pair has same names\" condition. Since N <= M (4 <= 6), we can always find 4 distinct girls to pair with the 4 boys.\n\nSo, based on this interpretation, the answer is **Yes**.\n\n**What if the problem implies that the names on line 2 and 3 are *all* the names in the class, and N and M are just counts, and we need to check if *any* boy's name matches *any* girl's name from the *provided lists*?**\n\nLet's take the full lists from the example input:\nBoy Names (from line 2): `Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya Krishnam Mahesh Nakul Sahil`\nGirl Names (from line 3): `Aakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan Nidhi Tarangini Vidisha Yukta`\n\nLet's find the intersection of these two sets of names:\nSet B = {Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya, Krishnam, Mahesh, Nakul, Sahil}\nSet G = {Aakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan, Nidhi, Tarangini, Vidisha, Yukta}\n\nIntersection (B intersect G) = {} (empty set)\n\nSince there are no common names between the *provided lists*, it means that no boy's name will ever match a girl's name. Therefore, any pairing will satisfy the condition.\n\n**Conclusion based on the most plausible interpretation of the problem statement and the given example:**\n\nThe problem asks if \"at least one such configuration exists where no pair has same names\".\nThis means we need to find if there's a way to pair each of the N boys with a distinct girl such that the boy's name is not the same as the girl's name.\n\nLet `B_names` be the set of N boy names.\nLet `G_names` be the set of M girl names.\n\nIf `B_names` and `G_names` have no common elements (i.e., `B_names` intersect `G_names` is empty), then any boy can be paired with any girl without a name conflict. Since N <= M (4 <= 6), we can always find N distinct girls for N boys. Thus, a valid configuration always exists.\n\nIn the given example:\nN = 4, M = 6\nBoy names (assuming the first N names from line 2): Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya\nGirl names (assuming the first M names from line 3): Aakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan\n\nChecking for common names:\n\"Abhishek\" is not in girl names.\n\"Rohan\" is not in girl names.\n\"Advait\" is not in girl names.\n\"Divya\" is not in girl names.\n\nNo common names. Therefore, a configuration where no pair has the same name exists.\n\nThe answer is **Yes**.\n\n**Final check on the problem wording:** \"Note that there can be more than 1 pair having same name\". This sentence is still a bit odd. It might be a distractor or refer to a scenario where, for example, Boy1 (name \"John\") is paired with Girl1 (name \"Mary\"), and Boy2 (name \"Peter\") is paired with Girl2 (name \"Mary\"). This is allowed. The constraint is only `boy_name != girl_name` *within the same pair*.\n\nGiven the input, the simplest and most direct interpretation leads to \"Yes\".", "Yes", "The correct word to fill the blank in the sentence \"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night\" is **'appointment'**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **Unannounced** directly implies that there was no prior arrangement or **appointment**.\n*   **Solicitation** refers to asking for something, which doesn't fit the context of someone simply showing up.\n*   **Meeting** implies a planned gathering, which contradicts \"unannounced.\"\n\nTherefore, the index of the correct word is **0**.", "2,3,1,5,4", "*My gaze, sharp and assessing, sweeps over the three objects presented, my mind already sifting through the possibilities.

Both strings A and B are sets of words separated by underscores.\n\nLet's break down the problem into smaller steps:\n\n1.  **Parse the input strings:** We need to split strings A and B into individual words. Since the words are separated by underscores, we can use the underscore as a delimiter.\n2.  **Store the words:** To efficiently check for the presence of words, it's best to store them in a data structure that allows for quick lookups. A hash set (or a `Set` in JavaScript, `HashSet` in Java, `set` in Python) is ideal for this purpose because it provides average O(1) time complexity for checking if an element exists.\n3.  **Compare the sets of words:** Iterate through each word in the parsed words of string A. For each word, check if it exists in the set of words from string B.\n4.  **Determine the result:** If all words from string A are found in the set from string B, then A is a subset of B, and the output should be \"YES\". If even one word from string A is not found in the set from string B, then A is not a subset of B, and the output should be \"NO\".\n\nLet's apply this to the given example:\nA = \"dog_cat_mouse\"\nB = \"cat_dog_rat_mouse\"\n\n**Step 1 & 2: Parse and Store**\n\n*   Split A: `[\"dog\", \"cat\", \"mouse\"]`\n*   Create a set from B: `setB = {\"cat\", \"dog\", \"rat\", \"mouse\"}`\n\n**Step 3: Compare**\n\n*   Check \"dog\" (from A) in `setB`: Yes, \"dog\" is in `setB`.\n*   Check \"cat\" (from A) in `setB`: Yes, \"cat\" is in `setB`.\n*   Check \"mouse\" (from A) in `setB`: Yes, \"mouse\" is in `setB`.\n\n**Step 4: Determine Result**\n\nSince all words from A are found in `setB`, the output is \"YES\".\n\nThis approach ensures that the order of words does not matter and that duplicate words in A (if they were allowed, though the problem states \"set of words\") would still be correctly checked against the presence in B.\n\n```python\ndef is_subset(A: str, B: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if all words in string A are present in string B.\n\n    Args:\n        A: A string of words separated by \"_\".\n        B: A string of words separated by \"_\".\n\n    Returns:\n        \"YES\" if all words in A are present in B, \"NO\" otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    words_a = A.split('_')\n    words_b_set = set(B.split('_'))\n\n    for word in words_a:\n        if word not in words_b_set:\n            return \"NO\"\n    return \"YES\"\n\n# Test cases\nprint(is_subset(\"dog_cat_mouse\", \"cat_dog_rat_mouse\"))  # Expected: YES\nprint(is_subset(\"apple_banana\", \"banana_orange_apple\")) # Expected: YES\nprint(is_subset(\"red_blue\", \"blue_green_yellow\"))      # Expected: NO (red is missing)\nprint(is_subset(\"one\", \"one_two_three\"))                # Expected: YES\nprint(is_subset(\"four_five\", \"one_two_three\"))          # Expected: NO (four, five are missing)\nprint(is_subset(\"a_b_c\", \"c_a_b_d_e\"))                  # Expected: YES\nprint(is_subset(\"a_b_c\", \"a_b\"))                        # Expected: NO (c is missing)\nprint(is_subset(\"\", \"a_b_c\"))                           # Expected: YES (empty set is a subset of any set)\nprint(is_subset(\"a_b_c\", \"\"))                           # Expected: NO (unless A is empty)\nprint(is_subset(\"a_a_b\", \"a_b_c\"))                      # Expected: YES (duplicates in A don't matter, only presence)\n```", "*My gaze, usually fixed on the intricate dance of human ambition, shifts to the numbers you present.
