We use `//` for integer division.\n\n2. **Calculate the Actual Sum:**\n   - We calculate the sum of all the elements in the input array `arr` using the `sum()` function.\n\n3. **Find the Difference:**\n   - The duplicate integer is the difference between the `actual_sum` and the `expected_sum`.  This is because the duplicate integer is present twice in the array, while the other integers are present only once.\n\n4. **Return the Duplicate:**\n   - The function returns the calculated duplicate integer.\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n\n- **Time Complexity:** O(N) - We iterate through the array once to calculate the sum.\n- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - We use a constant amount of extra space.\n\nThis solution is efficient and avoids using extra data structures like hash maps, making it a good choice for this problem.

Since we\u2019re only given the length of one side (9 meters), we need to assume it\u2019s an equilateral triangle for simplicity. However, the problem doesn\u2019t state that. Let\u2019s proceed assuming it\u2019s a general triangle. We\u2019ll need to know the other two sides and the height to calculate the area. Since that information isn\u2019t provided, we\u2019ll have to make an assumption.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the triangle is right-angled with the 9-meter side being one leg and the perpendicular height being the other. Then the area of the triangle would be:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 9 * 12 = 54 square meters.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the lateral surface area of the prism. This is the area of the three rectangular faces. The dimensions of each rectangle are:\n\n*   9 meters (base) x 12 meters (height) = 108 square meters.\n*   This will be repeated three times, so the total lateral surface area is 3 * 108 = 324 square meters.\n\nFinally, we need to calculate the area of the two triangular bases. We already calculated the area of one base as 54 square meters. Since there are two identical bases, the total area of the bases is 2 * 54 = 108 square meters.\n\nThe total surface area of the triangular prism is the sum of the lateral surface area and the area of the two bases:\n\nTotal Surface Area = Lateral Surface Area + Area of Two Bases = 324 + 108 = 432 square meters.\n\nTherefore, the total surface area of the triangular prism is 432 square meters.\n\n**Answer: 432.0**", "(I pause, considering the question carefully.

It adds a savory, umami flavor.\n*   **Tabasco Sauce:** For a kick of heat \u2013 a few dashes.\n*   **Celery Salt:** To season the drink.\n*   **Black Pepper:** Freshly ground black pepper.\n*   **Pickle Juice:** A splash of pickle juice adds a tangy flavor and complexity.\n*   **Garnish:** This is where it gets really fun!

This is crucial for easily identifying the missing number.\n3. **Iterate and Compare:** The code then iterates through the sorted list, comparing each number to the next.\n4. **Check for Gap:** Inside the loop, `if numbers[i+1] - numbers[i] > 1:` checks if the difference between consecutive numbers is greater than 1. If it is, it means there's a gap, and the missing number is the number immediately after the current number (`numbers[i] + 1`).\n5. **Handle Missing Number at Beginning or End:** If the loop completes without finding a gap, it means the missing number is either at the beginning or the end of the sequence.\n   - `if numbers[0] != 1:` checks if the first number in the list is not 1. If it's not, then 1 is the missing number.\n   - `else: return numbers[-1] + 1` If the loop completes without finding a gap, the missing number is one greater than the last number in the list.\n\nThis function efficiently finds the missing number in a list of consecutive integers, even if the list is not sorted.

I seem genuinely focused on the task.)\n\nOkay\u2026 let\u2019s do the math. You\u2019re 18 years old, and I\u2019m\u2026 well, I\u2019m a little older than that.\n\n(I tap my pen against my notepad) If there are 365 days in a year, and you\u2019ve been alive for 18 years, then you\u2019ve experienced 18 * 365 = 6570 days.\n\n(I look up, a slight smile playing on my lips) So, you\u2019re 18 years old. And I\u2019m\u2026 6570 days old. That\u2019s\u2026 a lot of days.\n\n(I offer a hopeful glance) It\u2019s a good thing we\u2019re talking about it!", "B", "Yes, the text contains profanity. Specifically, it mentions the \u201cF-word\u201d repeatedly.", "That argument is **invalid**.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\nThe premises state that all dogs are animals, and that Zeus is not a dog. However, this doesn\u2019t automatically mean Zeus isn\u2019t an animal. He could be another type of animal \u2013 a cat, a bird, a horse, etc. \u2013 and the premises wouldn\u2019t be contradicted.\n\nThis is a classic example of a logical fallacy called *denying the antecedent*.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like to try another argument!", "Okay, I\u2019ve analyzed both images.\n\n**The two images do not have exactly the same content.**\n\nWhile they depict similar scenes \u2013 a man in a suit standing in front of a building \u2013 there are key differences:\n\n*   **The building:** The building in image1 appears to be a modern glass skyscraper, while the building in image2 looks like an older brick structure.\n*   **The man\u2019s attire:** The man in image1 is wearing a dark suit and tie, while the man in image2 is wearing a lighter-colored suit.\n*   **The background details:** There are subtle differences in the background elements, such as the trees and the sky.\n\nTherefore, despite the overall similarity, the images are not identical.", "(I pace a little, a thoughtful expression crossing my face. I seem genuinely focused, analyzing the situation.)\n\nOkay, this is\u2026 a classic. No money, lunch time. Let\u2019s not panic. Optimal solution requires a strategic approach. First, assess resources.\n\n(I stop pacing and lean against the wall) Immediately, I\u2019d scout the area. Not for a fancy restaurant, obviously. I\u2019d look for\u2026 discarded food. Fruit trees, perhaps? Overripe produce in a grocery store dumpsters \u2013 check for salvageable items. A park might have leftover picnic lunches.\n\n(I shift in my chair, a touch of practicality in my voice) Simultaneously, I\u2019d leverage my\u2026 network. I\u2019d approach colleagues, friends, anyone I could. \u201cHey, I\u2019m in a bit of a bind. No lunch money. Any spare sandwich or fruit you\u2019d be willing to share?\u201d A little charm and a genuine request often works wonders.\n\n(I lean forward slightly, a touch of earnestness in my voice) If those avenues fail, I\u2019d consider foraging. Not aggressively, of course. Just\u2026 politely asking a local farmer if they had any surplus vegetables they were willing to give away. A small gesture of gratitude goes a long way.\n\n(I look at you earnestly) The *optimal* solution, in this scenario, isn\u2019t about eating a gourmet meal. It\u2019s about securing sustenance. It\u2019s about resourcefulness and leveraging relationships. It\u2019s about prioritizing survival and finding a way to get through lunch.\n\n(I offer a hopeful glance) A simple, salvaged apple or a shared sandwich \u2013 that\u2019s the optimal solution. What would *you* do in that situation?", "Okay, let\u2019s break down John\u2019s story sentence by sentence:\n\n1.  **\u201cI went to the store.\u201d** - Best describes what happened **first**.

Sets are used because they provide very fast lookups (checking if an element is already present).\n   - Initializes an empty list called `result`. This will store the unique strings in their original order.\n\n2. **Iteration:**\n   - The code iterates through each `string` in the input list `strings`.\n\n3. **Duplicate Check:**\n   - `if string not in seen:`:  This checks if the current `string` has already been encountered.  The `in` operator on a set is very efficient.\n\n4. **Adding Unique Strings:**\n   - If the `string` is *not* in the `seen` set (meaning it's a new, unique string):\n     - `seen.add(string)`: The `string` is added to the `seen` set so that it won't be added to the `result` list again.\n     - `result.append(string)`: The `string` is appended to the `result` list, preserving the original order.\n\n5. **Return Value:**\n   - `return result`: The function returns the `result` list, which now contains only the unique strings from the original list, in their original order.\n\nThis approach is efficient because checking for membership in a set (`string not in seen`) takes, on average, O(1) time (constant time).  Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the number of strings in the input list.  This is much better than using nested loops, which would have a time complexity of O(n^2).", "Okay, let\u2019s calculate the tax.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the taxable amount \u2013 which is the item cost minus the shipping and handling charges:\n\nTaxable amount = Item cost - Shipping & handling charges\nTaxable amount = $100 - $10\nTaxable amount = $90\n\nNow, we can calculate the tax amount:\n\nTax amount = Taxable amount * Tax rate\nTax amount = $90 * 0.06\nTax amount = $5.40\n\nTherefore, the total amount of tax that needs to be paid is $5.40.\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the answer is **$5.40**.", "The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog.", "Okay, let\u2019s figure this out.

While an expert (like a business consultant) could offer valuable advice, a friend can provide a more empathetic and personalized response, considering the individual\u2019s circumstances, motivations, and concerns. A friend can offer support and help the person explore their thoughts and feelings about the decision. An online forum might offer general advice, but it wouldn\u2019t provide the tailored guidance needed for such a significant life choice.\n\nDo you want me to analyze another question?"]
