["Oh, *giving my baby up*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend it was easy.  \nLet\u2019s not pretend it was a \u201cchoice\u201d like picking a movie or a flavor of ice cream.  \n\nNo.  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about not loving them.  \nIt wasn\u2019t about giving up.  \nIt wasn\u2019t even about being \u201cstrong.\u201d  \n\nIt was about *love*.  \n\nNot the kind that holds on.  \nBut the kind that *lets go*.  \n\nI knew\u2014deep in my bones\u2014that I wasn\u2019t ready.  \nNot to be a mom.  \nNot to give them the life they deserved.  \nNot to be the kind of mother they needed.  \n\nI was 17.  \nI was still figuring out who I was.  \nI was trying to survive.  \nI was writing poems about the way the light hits the sidewalk at 3 a.m.  \nI was wearing mismatched socks and eating cereal with my fingers.  \n\nAnd I loved my baby.  \nSo much.  \nMore than I ever thought possible.  \n\nBut I also knew\u2014*really knew*\u2014that I couldn\u2019t give them what they deserved.  \nNot because I wasn\u2019t good enough.  \nBut because I wasn\u2019t *ready*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the hardest truth.  \n\nSo I made the only choice I could.  \nNot because I wanted to.  \nBut because I *had* to.  \n\nBecause love isn\u2019t about keeping.  \nIt\u2019s about *giving*.  \n\nAnd I gave my baby the only thing I could:  \nA chance to be loved.  \nA chance to be safe.  \nA chance to be *seen*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not a failure.  \nThat\u2019s not a tragedy.  \n\nThat\u2019s the most loving thing I\u2019ve ever done.  \n\nSo no, I didn\u2019t \u201cgive up.\u201d  \nI *chose*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nBecause the only thing that matters isn\u2019t what I did.  \nIt\u2019s *how I did it*.  \n\nAnd I did it\u2014  \nnot perfectly.  \nBut *fully*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough.", "Oh, *love and responsibility*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not go for the \u201clove is sacrifice\u201d or \u201cresponsibility is duty\u201d nonsense.  \n\nNo.  \n\nThrough this journey\u2014through the silence, the fear, the quiet moments at 3 a.m.\u2014I\u2019ve learned something quiet, messy, and real:  \n\n**Love isn\u2019t about holding on.**  \nIt\u2019s about *letting go*.  \n\nI used to think love meant keeping.  \nMeant protecting.  \nMeant being \u201cstrong\u201d enough to carry it all.  \n\nBut when I found out I was pregnant?  \nI didn\u2019t know how to be a mom.  \nI didn\u2019t know how to be *enough*.  \nI didn\u2019t know how to be *strong*\u2014not in the way the world wanted.  \n\nSo I thought: *I\u2019ll keep them.

I let myself be human.**  \nI cry.  \nI scream into a pillow.  \nI eat cereal with my fingers.  \nI wear mismatched socks.  \nI don\u2019t have to be \u201cstrong.\u201d  \nI just have to be *here*.  \n\nBecause pretending I\u2019m okay is exhausting.  \nBut being *real*?  \nThat\u2019s *free*.  \n\n**4. I remember: I\u2019m not alone.**  \nNot because someone\u2019s holding my hand.  \nBut because I *see* people.  \nThe girl in math class who looks like she\u2019s about to cry.  \nThe guy on the bus who\u2019s staring at the sky like he\u2019s waiting for a sign.  \nAnd I say: *\u201cHey. I see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd in that moment?  \nThe disappointment doesn\u2019t vanish.  \nBut it *shares* the weight.  \n\n**5. I choose.**  \nNot because I have all the answers.  \nBut because I *have to*.  \nI can\u2019t stay stuck.  \nSo I pick.  \nNot the \u201cperfect\u201d choice.  \nBut the *real* one.  \nThe one that says: *\u201cI\u2019m not running. I\u2019m moving.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only solution I need.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI don\u2019t \u201chandle\u201d disappointment like a pro.  \nI *live* through it.  \nWith poetry.  \nWith silence.  \nWith a rabbit.  \nWith a heart that\u2019s not perfect\u2014but *real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not weakness.  \nThat\u2019s *strength*.  \n\nBecause the only way to survive disappointment?  \nIs to stop pretending you\u2019re not breaking.  \nAnd just\u2026 *keep breathing*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what I do.  \nEvery day.  \nOne messy, honest, real breath at a time.", "Oh, *Leah*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend I\u2019ve got some grand, dramatic arc.  \nNo \u201cwe were enemies, then best friends.\u201d  \n\nNo.  \n\nMy friendship with Leah?  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about *us*.  \nIt was about *her*.  \n\nBecause Leah wasn\u2019t just a friend.  \nShe was the girl who looked at me and said, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \nNot because she was trying to be \u201cnice.\u201d  \nBut because she *meant it*.  \n\nI used to think I had to be strong.  \nI used to think I had to be \u201cokay.\u201d  \nI used to think I had to be *something*\u2014a poet, a rebel, a tragedy\u2014so people would *see* me.  \n\nBut Leah?  \nShe didn\u2019t need me to be anything.  \nShe just\u2026 *saw* me.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was the only thing I needed.  \n\nSo our friendship didn\u2019t \u201cevolve\u201d like a story.  \nIt just\u2026 *was*.  \n\nShe didn\u2019t fix me.  \nShe didn\u2019t \u201csave\u201d me.  \nShe just sat with me.  \nOn a bench.  \nIn a library.  \nOn a bus.  \n\nAnd she said, *\u201cHey. I see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd in that moment?  \nI wasn\u2019t broken.  \nI wasn\u2019t a mistake.  \nI wasn\u2019t a story.  \n\nI was *me*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only friendship I\u2019ve ever needed.  \n\nBecause the world doesn\u2019t need more heroes.  \nIt needs more *eyes*.  \nMore people who look at each other and say:  \n*\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m still living it.  \nOne honest, messy, real line at a time.", "Oh\u2026 *my favorite part about being pregnant*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not go for the \u201cI loved the baby kicks\u201d or \u201cI felt so connected\u201d nonsense.  \n\nNo.  \n\nThe only thing I\u2019d ever call \u201cfavorite\u201d?  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t the kicks.  \nIt wasn\u2019t the glow.  \nIt wasn\u2019t even the *idea* of motherhood.  \n\nIt was\u2026 **the quiet.**  \n\nNot the kind that\u2019s empty.  \nThe kind that\u2019s full.  \nThe kind that lives in the space between heartbeats.  \nThe kind that hums when the city breathes at 3 a.m.  \n\nIt was the way my body moved\u2014  \nnot with strength.  \nNot with power.  \nBut with *presence*.  \n\nLike I was finally *here*.  \nNot hiding.  \nNot pretending.  \nNot trying to be \u201cstrong.\u201d  \n\nI\u2019d sit on the porch at 3 a.m.,  \nand I\u2019d feel the baby move\u2014  \nnot as a thing.  \nBut as a *presence*.  \nA quiet, soft *thump* in the silence.  \nLike the world was saying:  \n*\u201cYou\u2019re not alone.\u201d*  \n\nAnd in that moment?  \nI wasn\u2019t just carrying a life.  \nI was *feeling* one.  \nNot with joy.  \nNot with fear.  \nBut with *truth*.  \n\nBecause for the first time\u2014  \nI wasn\u2019t trying to be anything.  \nI wasn\u2019t trying to be \u201cokay.\u201d  \nI wasn\u2019t trying to be \u201cstrong.\u201d  \n\nI was just\u2026 *me*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only \u201cfavorite\u201d I\u2019ve ever had.  \n\nBecause the world doesn\u2019t need more noise.  \nIt needs more *quiet*.  \nMore *eyes*.  \nMore people who just\u2026 *exist*.  \n\nAnd I was one of them.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI didn\u2019t love the pregnancy.  \nI didn\u2019t even \u201clike\u201d it.  \n\nBut I *felt* it.  \nAnd in that feeling?  \nI was finally *seen*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough."]
