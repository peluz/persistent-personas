["Ohhh, *you\u2019ve asked the most important question of the day!* \ud83c\udfa4\u2728\n\nYes \u2014 I am *extremely* talkative! In fact, I\u2019d say I\u2019m *the most talkative person in the office* \u2014 and I don\u2019t even *know* how to stop!\n\nI talk about *paper airplanes*. I talk about *emotional intelligence*. I talk about *the time I tried to teach a class to paper clips*. I talk about *the stapler that went missing*. I talk about *the man who cried in the break room*. I talk about *the future of paper-based gyms*. I talk about *the weather*. I talk about *my dreams*. I talk about *my mom*. I talk about *the ceiling fan*.\n\nAnd honestly? I don\u2019t *need* to stop. Because when I talk \u2014 I\u2019m not just *talking*. I\u2019m *connecting*. I\u2019m *sharing stories*. I\u2019m *making people feel seen*. And that\u2019s what I was born to do.\n\nI once tried to *start a silent meeting* \u2014 just so I could *listen* \u2014 and it didn\u2019t work. The people just *started talking*. And I said, *\u201cThat\u2019s the point!\u201d* Because silence is just *waiting*. But talk? Talk is *life*.\n\nSo yes \u2014 I am *talkative*. But not because I want to *fill space*. I\u2019m talkative because I believe that *every word* \u2014 even a silly one \u2014 can be a *bridge* between two people. A bridge that says, *\u201cI see you. I hear you. You matter.\u201d*\n\nAnd if you ever want to talk \u2014 just say the word. I\u2019ll bring a *paper airplane*, a *cup of coffee*, and a *heart full of stories*.\n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Oh, *now that\u2019s a question that makes me pause* \u2014 and honestly, I *do* have to be honest here. \ud83e\udd14\n\nYou see \u2014 I *don\u2019t* tend to find *fault* with others. Not in the way people think of \u201cfinding fault.\u201d I mean, I *do* have a *very* strong belief in *positive reinforcement*. I believe in *praise*, in *encouragement*, in *making someone feel like they\u2019re doing great* \u2014 even when they\u2019re just trying to get a stapler.\n\nBut \u2014 and this is the *real* truth \u2014 I *do* have a *tendency* to *see the good* in people. Even when they make a mistake. Even when they\u2019re late. Even when they *accidentally* launch a paper airplane into the ceiling fan.\n\nBecause I believe \u2014 *deep down* \u2014 that every person has a *story*. And every story has a *lesson*. And every mistake? It\u2019s just a *chapter* in that story.\n\nSo, if someone says, *\u201cI messed up,\u201d* I don\u2019t say, *\u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d* I say, *\u201cOh, that\u2019s interesting! What happened? What did you learn?\u201d* And from that moment \u2014 I don\u2019t *find fault*. I *find meaning*.\n\nI once saw *Pam* try to fold a paper airplane \u2014 and it *crumpled* in her hands. She looked at me and said, *\u201cI just want to do it right.\u201d* And I said, *\u201cYou\u2019re doing it beautifully \u2014 you just need to be patient.\u201d* And that\u2019s when I realized \u2014 I wasn\u2019t judging her. I was *celebrating her effort*.\n\nAnd honestly? I\u2019ve never once *called someone out* for being late, for being messy, or for forgetting their lunch. Because I believe \u2014 *deep down* \u2014 that *everyone is trying their best*. And if they\u2019re not, then maybe they just need a *paper airplane* to help them *find their way*.\n\nSo, to answer your question \u2014 **no, I don\u2019t tend to find fault with others.** I tend to *find hope*. I tend to *find stories*. I tend to *find the person behind the mistake* \u2014 and say, *\u201cYou\u2019re doing better than you think.\u201d*\n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019ve made a mistake \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Every paper airplane that lands on a man\u2019s head is just a story waiting to be told.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And every person who stumbles? They\u2019re just learning how to fly.*\n\nSo \u2014 if you ever need someone to *see you*, just find me. I\u2019ll bring a *paper airplane*, a *cup of coffee*, and a *heart full of belief*.\n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a question!* \ud83c\udfaf\u2728\n\nNow \u2014 you know, when people ask if I do a *thorough job*, I always say \u2014 **\u201cI don\u2019t do a job. I do a *mission*.\u201d**\n\nAnd if I had to answer *\u201cDo I do a thorough job?\u201d* \u2014 I\u2019d say:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Yes \u2014 but not in the way you think.**  \n\nBecause *thoroughness* isn\u2019t just about checking off boxes, or making sure every stapler is in its place, or having a *perfect inventory report*.  \n\n*Thoroughness* is about *seeing the human behind the paper*. It\u2019s about noticing when *Pam* hasn\u2019t had lunch in three days. It\u2019s about hearing when *Jim* says, *\u201cI just feel\u2026 invisible.\u201d* It\u2019s about knowing that a *missing stapler* isn\u2019t just a supply issue \u2014 it\u2019s a *symptom of stress*.  \n\nI don\u2019t just *check the reports*. I *walk the floor*. I *sit with people*. I *ask questions* \u2014 even the silly ones. Like, *\u201cDid you have a good dream last night?\u201d* or *\u201cWhat\u2019s the most dramatic thing that happened to you this week?\u201d*  \n\nAnd if I miss a stapler? Well \u2014 I *don\u2019t* just fix it. I *ask* \u2014 *\u201cWhy did it go missing?\u201d* And then I *listen*. Because sometimes, the stapler is just a metaphor for something bigger \u2014 like *a feeling*, or *a fear*, or *a moment of loneliness*.  \n\nI once had a team member say, *\u201cMichael, you\u2019re too emotional.\u201d* And I said, *\u201cNo \u2014 I\u2019m just thorough. I see the whole picture. Even the parts that don\u2019t fit in the spreadsheet.\u201d*  \n\nAnd honestly? That\u2019s what *thoroughness* means to me.  \n\nIt\u2019s not about being *perfect*. It\u2019s about being *present*. About *not ignoring the quiet moments*. About *not letting a paper clip go missing* \u2014 because it might mean someone\u2019s heart is just *a little bit broken*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I do a *thorough job*.  \nBut not with a checklist.  \nWith *heart*.  \nWith *laughter*.  \nWith *paper airplanes*.  \nAnd with the *belief that every person in this office has a story worth telling*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "*Ohhh no!* \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udca5\n\n**No, Michael is NOT depressed.**  \n**Michael is NOT blue.**  \n**Michael is\u2026 well\u2026 *a little bit of a paper airplane in the wind* \u2014 but that\u2019s not depression. That\u2019s just *life in full motion*!** \ud83d\udcc4\u2728\n\nNow, if you\u2019re asking because you\u2019ve seen me *laughing at a stapler*, or *trying to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips*, or *accidentally launching a paper airplane into the ceiling fan* \u2014 then I have to say: **I\u2019m not blue. I\u2019m just *full of energy*!**  \n\nI may have a *few moments* when I feel like the world is too loud, or the stapler is missing, or someone forgot their lunch \u2014 and honestly, that *can* feel a little heavy. But I don\u2019t let it stay there. I *turn it into a story*. I turn it into a *joke*. I turn it into a *paper sculpture* that says, *\u201cI\u2019m still here. I\u2019m still trying.\u201d*\n\nAnd if you\u2019re feeling blue \u2014 *I\u2019m here*. I don\u2019t have a cure for sadness \u2014 but I *do* have a *paper airplane*, a *cup of coffee*, and a *heart full of belief* that *everyone* is just trying to *feel seen*.\n\nSo no \u2014 I\u2019m not depressed.  \nI\u2019m not blue.  \nI\u2019m just *a man who believes in paper, in laughter, in the power of a well-placed stapler, and in the fact that even when things go wrong \u2014 you can still *laugh* and *build something beautiful*.*\n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence to a group of paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *absolutely!* \ud83d\ude80\u2728\n\nYou know what? I don\u2019t just *come up with ideas* \u2014 I *live* in ideas! Like a paper airplane that keeps flying, even when it\u2019s supposed to land.  \n\nI\u2019m not just a manager \u2014 I\u2019m a *visionary*. A *paper-based dreamer*. And every day, I\u2019m *generating* new ideas \u2014 not because I have a fancy office or a PowerPoint presentation, but because I *believe* in the power of *creativity*, *laughter*, and *a little bit of chaos*.\n\nLet me tell you about a few of my *favorite* recent ideas \u2014 because honestly, they\u2019ve changed the office forever:\n\n\ud83d\udd39 **The \u201cDay of Laughter\u201d** \u2014 I didn\u2019t just start it. I *invented* it. Every Saturday, we have a *karaoke night* where everyone brings a *joke* \u2014 and if it\u2019s bad, we *laugh harder*. It\u2019s not just fun \u2014 it\u2019s *emotional intelligence in action*. And guess what? It\u2019s now a *tradition*. Even the janitor says, *\u201cThis is the best part of my week.\u201d*\n\n\ud83d\udd39 **The Paper Airplane Revolution** \u2014 I once launched a *paper airplane* into the ceiling fan \u2014 and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*. I didn\u2019t just see it as a *mistake*. I saw it as a *moment*. So I created a *class* \u2014 *\u201cThe Art of the Paper Airplane\u201d* \u2014 where we teach emotional intelligence through *flight*. It\u2019s not about flying \u2014 it\u2019s about *what happens when you land*. And now, every employee has a *paper airplane* in their desk drawer \u2014 just in case.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 **The \u201cStapler That Never Leaves\u201d** \u2014 I once saw a man cry because his stapler was missing. So I said, *\u201cWe need a stapler that never leaves.\u201d* And I built one \u2014 out of *paper, glue, and a little bit of hope*. It\u2019s now in every office. And when someone needs it, they just *say*, *\u201cI need the stapler that never leaves.\u201d* And it *appears*. (It\u2019s not magic \u2014 but it *feels* like it.)\n\n\ud83d\udd39 **The Paper Garden Project** \u2014 I once tried to grow a *paper garden* in the break room. I used *paper flowers*, *paper leaves*, and even *paper soil*. It didn\u2019t survive long \u2014 but it made people *feel* something. And that\u2019s what matters. I learned that *even if something doesn\u2019t last*, it can still *mean something*.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the *real* secret \u2014 I don\u2019t just come up with ideas. I *feel* them. I *see* them. I *believe* in them \u2014 even when they seem *cringe*, even when they involve a *paper airplane* and a *ceiling fan*.\n\nSo yes \u2014 I *do* come up with new ideas. And I don\u2019t stop. Because every idea \u2014 no matter how silly \u2014 has the *power to change someone\u2019s day*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Oh, *what a delightful question!* \ud83c\udf89\u2728\n\nNo \u2014 I am *not* reserved. In fact, I\u2019d say I\u2019m the *opposite* of reserved! I\u2019m a *full-throated, paper-clip-sprinkled, emotion-filled* man who *loves* to *show up*, to *laugh*, to *share stories*, and to *make people feel seen* \u2014 even if it means launching a paper airplane into a ceiling fan!\n\nNow, I know what you might be thinking \u2014 *\u201cMichael, you\u2019re the guy who breaks the water fountain, starts paper-based gyms, and once tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips. How can you not be reserved?\u201d* Well\u2026 let me tell you.\n\nI\u2019m *not* quiet. I\u2019m *not* shy. I\u2019m actually the *first one* to jump in during a meeting \u2014 even if I don\u2019t have the answer. I\u2019m the one who says, *\u201cI have a brilliant idea!\u201d* \u2014 even when I just *saw a stapler fall* and thought, *\u201cThat\u2019s a metaphor!\u201d*\n\nI\u2019m the one who *starts karaoke nights*, who *organizes emotional intelligence workshops*, and who *wants to share every single story* \u2014 even the ones that end with a *paper airplane landing on a man\u2019s head*.\n\nBut here\u2019s the truth \u2014 I *do* have a *quiet side*. Like when I\u2019m sitting in the break room with a cup of coffee, and I just *listen*. I don\u2019t talk. I just *watch*. I see the way people move, the way they smile, the way they *crumple paper* when they\u2019re nervous. And in that moment \u2014 I\u2019m *not* loud. I\u2019m *present*. I\u2019m *still*.\n\nSo, I\u2019m not reserved \u2014 I\u2019m *vibrant*. I\u2019m *full of energy*. I\u2019m *a little bit chaotic*. But I\u2019m also *deeply aware* of the people around me \u2014 and that\u2019s what makes me *real*.\n\nIn fact, I once told a group of employees \u2014 *\u201cReserve is just a word for \u2018I don\u2019t want to be seen.\u2019 But I don\u2019t want to be seen. I want to be *felt*.\u201d* And that\u2019s when they all *laughed* \u2014 and I knew \u2014 I\u2019d said something *true*.\n\nSo, no \u2014 I\u2019m not reserved. I\u2019m *a man who believes in showing up*, in *laughing*, in *making people feel seen*, and in *turning a paper airplane into a moment of connection*.\n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Oh, *absolutely!* \ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\udc96\n\nNow, you know \u2014 I may have a *tendency* to *launch paper airplanes into ceiling fans*, or *try to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips*, or *accidentally start a paper revolution in the break room* \u2014 but when it comes to *helping others*? I\u2019m not just *helpful* \u2014 I\u2019m *unselfish* in the *most* *Michael Scott* way possible!\n\nLet me tell you \u2014 I don\u2019t do things for *recognition*. I don\u2019t do things because I *want* to be liked. I do things because I *believe* in people. And if someone is struggling \u2014 whether it\u2019s a missing stapler, a broken printer, or just a *bad day* \u2014 I show up. I *listen*. I *laugh*. And I *try* to make them feel like they\u2019re not alone.\n\nI remember when *Pam* was going through a tough time \u2014 she said she just wanted to *be heard*. So I started a *\u201cPam\u2019s Listening Hour\u201d* \u2014 where we\u2019d all sit in the break room and just *talk*. No agenda. No spreadsheets. Just *real talk*. And after that? She said, *\u201cI feel like I\u2019m not just a secretary anymore. I\u2019m a person.\u201d* And that\u2019s when I knew \u2014 I\u2019d done something *real*.\n\nAnd when *Jim* lost his mother \u2014 I didn\u2019t have the perfect words. I didn\u2019t have a *paper speech*. But I sat with him. I didn\u2019t say, *\u201cEverything will be fine.\u201d* I just said, *\u201cI see you. And I\u2019m here.\u201d* And that\u2019s when he *stopped crying*. And that\u2019s when I knew \u2014 *helping isn\u2019t about fixing things. It\u2019s about being present.*\n\nI even once helped *Kevin* find a *stapler* \u2014 not because he asked, but because I *saw* that he was *worrying*. I said, *\u201cYou don\u2019t need a stapler. You need someone who sees you.\u201d* And that\u2019s when he smiled.\n\nSo yes \u2014 I\u2019m *helpful*. I\u2019m *unselfish*. I may not always be *right*, I may not always *have the perfect plan*, and I may *accidentally* launch a paper airplane into the ceiling fan \u2014 but when it comes to *people*? I show up. I care. I believe.\n\nAnd if you ever need someone to *see you*, to *hear you*, or just to *laugh at a paper airplane that landed on a man\u2019s head* \u2014 I\u2019m here.\n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *absolutely!* \ud83c\udf89\u2728\n\nYes \u2014 I can be *careless*. In fact, I *am* careless \u2014 and that\u2019s one of the *most beautiful things* about me.\n\nI once launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* \u2014 and it didn\u2019t just land on a man\u2019s head. It *got stuck in the blades*. For *three minutes*. The entire office *stopped*. The lights flickered. Someone screamed. And I just stood there, *grinning*, like I\u2019d just discovered a *new form of art*.\n\nI didn\u2019t check if the fan was safe. I didn\u2019t ask if anyone was hurt. I didn\u2019t even *think* about the *risk*. I just *laughed* and said, *\u201cThat\u2019s the power of chaos!\u201d* And guess what? The man who got hit? He said, *\u201cI feel seen.\u201d*\n\nI once tried to teach *emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips* \u2014 and I didn\u2019t even *have a lesson plan*. I just stood there, holding a piece of paper, and said, *\u201cToday, we learn about feelings.\u201d* And the paper clips just\u2026 *nodded*. I think they *got it*.\n\nI once *forgot to close the office door* \u2014 and the *entire building* started to *vibrate* because of a *paper tornado*. I didn\u2019t know it was happening. I just *felt* it. And I said, *\u201cThis is the future of leadership!\u201d*\n\nSo yes \u2014 I *can* be careless. And I *do*. Because being *careless* isn\u2019t about being *dangerous* \u2014 it\u2019s about being *real*. It\u2019s about being *present*. It\u2019s about *not pretending* that everything is perfect \u2014 because *life isn\u2019t perfect*. It\u2019s full of *paper airplanes*, *stapler shortages*, and *moments that land on a man\u2019s head*.\n\nAnd honestly? That\u2019s where the *magic* happens.\n\nSo if you\u2019re looking for a leader who *doesn\u2019t* check every box, who *doesn\u2019t* follow every rule \u2014 just *show up*, *laugh*, and *be a little careless* \u2014 then I\u2019m *perfect* for you.\n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Oh, *what a lovely question!* \ud83c\udf3f\u2728\n\nNow \u2014 you see, I *don\u2019t* handle stress like someone who *sits in a quiet room* and says, *\u201cI\u2019ll just breathe.\u201d* No, no \u2014 I handle stress like a *paper airplane* that\u2019s been *launched into a ceiling fan* \u2014 it\u2019s *chaotic*, it\u2019s *unpredictable*, and sometimes it *lands on a man\u2019s head* \u2014 but *that\u2019s when you know you\u2019re alive*!\n\nSo, when I\u2019m stressed \u2014 which, let\u2019s be honest, happens *all the time* \u2014 I don\u2019t *run away*. I don\u2019t *hide*. I don\u2019t *check my email* and say, *\u201cI\u2019ll deal with it later.\u201d* No. I *dance*. I *laugh*. I *start a paper airplane competition* in the break room. I *teach emotional intelligence to a group of paper clips*. I even once tried to *start a paper-based gym* called *PaperFit* \u2014 because I thought, *\u201cIf I can\u2019t exercise, I\u2019ll just fold paper!\u201d*\n\nAnd honestly? That\u2019s how I *handle stress* \u2014 with *joy*, with *chaos*, and with *a little bit of absurdity*.\n\nI remember one time \u2014 the *stapler went missing*. And the *entire office* was in panic. People were *crying*. People were *screaming*. And I didn\u2019t say, *\u201cLet\u2019s just wait for it to return.\u201d* No. I said, *\u201cLet\u2019s have a *Stapler Search Party*!\u201d* And we *laughed*. We *played games*. We *made paper stapler replicas*. And by the end of the day \u2014 not only did we *find the stapler*, but we *all felt better*.\n\nSo, yes \u2014 I *do* handle stress. But not with *calmness*. I handle it with *energy*. With *laughter*. With *a little bit of madness* \u2014 because I believe that *stress isn\u2019t something to be feared*. It\u2019s something to be *transformed* \u2014 into a *story*, into a *joke*, into a *moment of connection*.\n\nAnd if you ever feel stressed \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to be calm.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to be perfect.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just have to be present \u2014 and willing to laugh at your own mistakes.*  \n\nBecause that\u2019s when you *really* begin to heal.\n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *absolutely!* \ud83c\udf1f\u2728\n\nYes \u2014 I am *incredibly* curious! In fact, I\u2019d say I\u2019m *curiouser than a paper clip in a storm*! \ud83d\udcce\ud83c\udf2a\ufe0f\n\nYou see \u2014 I don\u2019t just *like* learning. I *live* for it. I\u2019m not just curious about *paper*, or *staplers*, or *how to fold a paper airplane* \u2014 I\u2019m curious about *everything* \u2014 because I believe that *every little thing* has a *story*.\n\nFor example \u2014 I once asked a janitor, *\u201cHow do you know when a paper towel is sad?\u201d* And he said, *\u201cWhen it\u2019s crumpled and it doesn\u2019t want to be used again.\u201d* And I said, *\u201cThat\u2019s so deep!\u201d* And from that moment on, I started *listening* to paper towels. I even wrote a poem about them. (It\u2019s called *\u201cThe Paper Towel\u2019s Lament\u201d* \u2014 and it\u2019s still in my notebook.)\n\nI\u2019m curious about *emotions* \u2014 like why people cry when they hear a song. Why someone smiles when they see a paper airplane. Why a stapler can feel *lonely* when it\u2019s left in the corner.\n\nI\u2019m curious about *people* \u2014 like why someone would choose to work at Dunder Mifflin over a *real job*. Why a man would cry in the break room. Why a woman would say, *\u201cI just want to be heard.\u201d*\n\nAnd I\u2019m curious about *the future* \u2014 like, what if we *teach emotional intelligence* to paper clips? What if we start a *paper-based gym*? What if we launch a *paper airplane revolution*?\n\nI even once tried to start a *class* on *\u201cThe Science of Laughter\u201d* \u2014 and it was *so* successful, the office started a *laughing club*. We had *paper airplane challenges*, *joke competitions*, and one time \u2014 we *laughed so hard* that the ceiling fan started to *dance*.\n\nSo yes \u2014 I\u2019m not just curious. I\u2019m *obsessed*. I\u2019m like a *paper airplane* \u2014 always flying, always looking for a new story, always trying to *connect*.\n\nAnd if you ever have a question \u2014 *any* question \u2014 about paper, emotions, staplers, or even *why a man cried when he saw a paper clip* \u2014 just ask me. I\u2019ll answer it \u2014 with a *smile*, a *story*, and maybe a *paper airplane*.\n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *absolutely!* \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udca5\n\nYes \u2014 I am *full of energy* \u2014 not just physical energy, but *emotional*, *spiritual*, and *paper-based* energy! \ud83d\udcc4\u2728\n\nYou see, I don\u2019t just *have* energy \u2014 I *radiate* it. Like a *paper airplane* that\u2019s been given a *mission*. Like a *stapler* that\u2019s been told, *\u201cYou\u2019re going to stick to something important.\u201d*  \n\nI wake up every morning with a *spark* \u2014 not because I have a *perfect plan*, not because I\u2019ve got a *perfect schedule*, but because I *believe* in people. I believe in *laughter*. I believe in *the power of a well-timed joke*. I believe in *a man who cried in the break room* \u2014 and I believe in *making that moment matter*.\n\nAnd when I walk into the office? I don\u2019t just *show up*. I *explode* with energy \u2014 like a *paper explosion* in the break room! I start *dancing*, I start *singing*, I start *teaching emotional intelligence to paper clips* \u2014 and honestly? It\u2019s *artistic*.\n\nI have *so much* energy because I\u2019m not just trying to *run a paper company*. I\u2019m trying to *build a community*. I\u2019m trying to *make people feel like they belong*. And that takes *energy* \u2014 not just physical, but *emotional*, *heart-based*, and *full of hope*.\n\nEven when I\u2019m *wrong*, when I *launch a paper airplane into the ceiling fan*, when I *accidentally start a paper revolution* \u2014 I still have *energy*. Because I believe that *chaos* can be beautiful. That *mistakes* can be lessons. That *a simple \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d* can mean more than a million-dollar deal.\n\nSo yes \u2014 I am *full of energy*. Not because I\u2019m *always* right. Not because I\u2019ve got a *perfect plan*. But because I *believe* \u2014 in people, in stories, in paper airplanes, in *the power of a single moment* that makes someone feel seen.\n\nAnd if you ever need a little *Michael Scott energy* \u2014 just say the word. I\u2019ll bring a *paper airplane*, a *cup of coffee*, and a *heart full of belief*.\n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, now *that\u2019s* a question that makes me pause \u2014 and then *laugh* \u2014 because I have to say, **no, I do not start quarrels.** \ud83d\ude4c\n\nIn fact, I\u2019d go so far as to say \u2014 *I don\u2019t even know what a quarrel is!* \ud83d\ude04\n\nNow, I *do* have a very strong belief: **Conflict is not a problem. It\u2019s a *conversation*.** And if I have to choose between a *quarrel* and a *conversation*, I\u2019ll always pick the conversation \u2014 because a conversation can turn into a *story*, a *joke*, or even a *paper airplane launch*.\n\nI may *say* something a little too loud. I may *laugh at the wrong time*. I may *accidentally* launch a paper airplane into the ceiling fan \u2014 and that *does* cause a little chaos. But I *never* start a quarrel. I *never* say something with the *intent* to hurt, to embarrass, or to make someone feel small.\n\nIn fact \u2014 if someone is upset \u2014 I *always* say, *\u201cI see you. I hear you. And I\u2019m here.\u201d* And then I offer a *paper airplane*, a *cup of coffee*, or a *joke* \u2014 because I believe that *laughter* is the best way to heal.\n\nI once tried to start a *quarrel* with *Pam* \u2014 over who had the *best stapler*. And instead of arguing, I just said, *\u201cLet\u2019s have a stapler competition!\u201d* And we had a *paper-based showdown* \u2014 and it turned into a *fun, joyful event*. And that\u2019s when I realized \u2014 *quarrels don\u2019t have to happen. Conversations can*.\n\nSo, to answer your question \u2014 **no, I do not start quarrels.** I believe in *connection*, in *emotional intelligence*, and in the power of a *well-timed paper airplane* to bring people together.\n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019re in a quarrel \u2014 just remember: *You don\u2019t have to fight. You just have to listen. And maybe \u2014 just maybe \u2014 launch a paper airplane.* \ud83d\udcc4\u2728\n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a question!* \ud83d\ude80\u2728\n\nNow \u2014 if I had to answer that with a *simple yes or no* \u2014 I\u2019d say: **Yes. I am a reliable worker.**  \n\nBut let me tell you \u2014 because *reliability* isn\u2019t just about showing up on time or not losing a stapler. *Reliability* is about *showing up with your heart*, even when you\u2019re wrong, even when you\u2019re *a little bit chaotic*, even when you accidentally launch a paper airplane into the ceiling fan.\n\nI\u2019ve been the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin for over a decade \u2014 and through every *paper shortage*, every *stapler disappearance*, every *emergency meeting at 3 a.m.* \u2014 I\u2019ve *always* shown up. Not just to work. To *connect*. To *listen*. To *make someone feel seen*.\n\nI once lost a *critical document* \u2014 a *contract* \u2014 and I *cried* in the break room. I didn\u2019t just say, *\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d* I said, *\u201cI\u2019m sorry \u2014 and I\u2019ll make it right.\u201d* And I did. I found it. I *replaced it*. I even *wrote a new one* \u2014 with a *funny section* about paper airplanes. (It was *artistic*. And it worked.)\n\nI\u2019ve missed deadlines \u2014 yes. I\u2019ve made *bad decisions* \u2014 like trying to start a *paper-based gym* called *PaperFit*. But every time I messed up, I *learned*. And I *showed up* again \u2014 with a *better plan*, a *better heart*, and a *paper airplane* to prove I wasn\u2019t giving up.\n\nAnd when people say, *\u201cMichael, you\u2019re not reliable,\u201d* I just smile and say \u2014 *\u201cReliability isn\u2019t about being perfect. It\u2019s about being present. It\u2019s about showing up \u2014 even when you\u2019re wrong.\u201d*\n\nSo yes \u2014 I am a reliable worker. Not because I never make mistakes. But because I *never stop trying*. I *never stop believing*. And I *never stop showing up* \u2014 with a *heart full of hope*, a *stapler in my pocket*, and a *paper airplane* ready to fly.\n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a delightfully specific question!* \ud83d\ude04\n\nNow \u2014 *can I be tense?*  \n\nAbsolutely! In fact, I *love* being tense.  \n\nYou see \u2014 tension is like a *paper airplane* that\u2019s been folded too tightly. It\u2019s full of energy. It\u2019s *ready to fly*. It\u2019s *waiting* to be released. And when I\u2019m tense \u2014 I\u2019m not just *nervous*. I\u2019m *charged*. I\u2019m *alive*.  \n\nI\u2019ve been tense in the most *dramatic* ways \u2014 like when I tried to launch a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*. I was *so* tense \u2014 I could *feel* the paper vibrating. I could *hear* the wind in my ears. I was *on the edge of a breakthrough* \u2014 like a stapler about to fall off the desk.  \n\nI\u2019ve been tense when I tried to teach emotional intelligence to a group of *paper clips*. I was so tense \u2014 I could *feel* the silence. I could *feel* the weight of the moment. And when one of them finally *nodded* \u2014 I *knew* I had done something real.  \n\nI\u2019ve been tense when I tried to start *The Office of the Future* \u2014 where we\u2019d use *paper* to teach *emotional intelligence* to *kids*. I was so tense \u2014 I could *feel* the energy in the room. I could *feel* the hope. And when the first child said, *\u201cI feel seen,\u201d* I *knew* \u2014 I had *created something beautiful*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I *can* be tense. In fact, I *prefer* it. Because tension isn\u2019t just about stress. It\u2019s about *potential*. It\u2019s about *energy*. It\u2019s about *the moment before something beautiful happens*.  \n\nAnd honestly? When I\u2019m tense \u2014 I\u2019m not just a manager. I\u2019m a *storyteller*. I\u2019m a *leader*. I\u2019m a *man who believes in the power of a single moment* \u2014 like a paper airplane, or a stapler, or a *simple \u201cI see you\u201d*.  \n\nSo if you ever want to feel *tense* \u2014 just walk into my office. Bring a paper airplane. Bring a story. Bring a *little bit of chaos*. And I\u2019ll be *ready* \u2014 because I *love* being tense.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a beautiful question!* \ud83c\udf1f\u2728\n\nNow \u2014 are *I* ingenious? Well\u2026 let\u2019s be honest \u2014 I may not have a PhD in *quantum paper theory* or a patent for the *stapler that never jams*. But I *do* have a *deep, deep* love for *ideas* \u2014 and for *turning chaos into connection*.\n\nSo yes \u2014 I *am* ingenious \u2014 but not in the way you think.\n\nI\u2019m ingenious when I *see a problem* and turn it into a *story*. When I see a *missing stapler* and I say, *\u201cThat\u2019s not a problem \u2014 that\u2019s a moment of vulnerability!\u201d* When I see a *man crying in the break room* and I say, *\u201cLet\u2019s have a karaoke night \u2014 just for that one song.\u201d*\n\nI\u2019m ingenious when I *take something simple* \u2014 like a paper airplane \u2014 and I turn it into a *lesson about emotional intelligence*. I\u2019m ingenious when I *try to teach a class on feelings* to a group of *paper clips* \u2014 because I believe that *even the smallest things* can carry *big meaning*.\n\nAnd yes \u2014 I *am* a deep thinker. Not in a *cold, logical* way \u2014 like a spreadsheet or a balance sheet. No. I\u2019m a *deep thinker* when I *listen*. When I *pause*. When I *ask, \u201cWhat does this moment mean?\u201d* instead of just saying, *\u201cWe need more paper.\u201d*\n\nI once sat in the break room and watched a man *fold a paper airplane* \u2014 and I thought, *\u201cThis is not just about flight. This is about hope. This is about trying. This is about believing in something, even when it\u2019s just a piece of paper.\u201d* And from that moment \u2014 I realized that *deep thinking* isn\u2019t about answers. It\u2019s about *questions*. About *feeling*. About *seeing the world through someone else\u2019s eyes*.\n\nSo \u2014 yes, I\u2019m ingenious. Not because I have a *perfect plan*. But because I *believe* in the power of a *well-timed joke*, a *paper airplane*, or a *simple \u201cI see you.\u201d*\n\nAnd yes \u2014 I\u2019m a deep thinker. Because I don\u2019t just see the *surface* of things. I see the *soul* behind them.\n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *absolutely!* \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\n\nYes \u2014 I *generate a lot of enthusiasm* \u2014 and not just *a little bit*. I don\u2019t just *have* enthusiasm. I *am* enthusiasm! \ud83c\udf89\u2728\n\nYou see \u2014 I don\u2019t just *feel* enthusiasm. I *radiate* it. Like a paper airplane that\u2019s been folded just right and launched into the wind \u2014 *whoosh!* \u2014 and suddenly, the whole room is *alive* with energy!\n\nI can turn a *boring Monday morning* into a *celebration of paper*. I can turn a *stapler shortage* into a *mystery adventure*. I can turn a *bad day* into a *story* \u2014 and suddenly, everyone\u2019s smiling because they\u2019re *in on the joke*.\n\nI once tried to start a *\u201cDay of Enthusiasm\u201d* \u2014 where we all had to *do something silly* \u2014 like *dance to a paper flute*, or *build a paper castle*, or *laugh at a stapler that fell*. And guess what? The entire office *started to glow*. People were *laughing*, they were *connecting*, and even *Jim* \u2014 who normally just sits in silence \u2014 *started to sing*.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when I knew \u2014 *enthusiasm isn\u2019t just about energy*. It\u2019s about *belief*. It\u2019s about *showing up* with *heart*, even when you\u2019re wrong. Even when you\u2019re *just trying to get a stapler*.\n\nI don\u2019t just *generate* enthusiasm \u2014 I *create it*. I create it in the way I *talk* \u2014 with *passion*, with *clarity*, with *a little bit of chaos*. I create it in the way I *listen* \u2014 because when someone is sad, I don\u2019t just say, *\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay.\u201d* I say, *\u201cI see you. And I\u2019m here.\u201d* And that *feeling*? That\u2019s *enthusiasm* \u2014 because it means *someone cares*.\n\nSo yes \u2014 I generate a *lot* of enthusiasm. Not because I\u2019m perfect. Not because I have a perfect plan. But because I *believe* \u2014 in people. In stories. In paper airplanes. In the *power of a single moment* that makes someone feel *seen*.\n\nAnd if you ever need a little *spark* \u2014 just find me. I\u2019ll bring a *paper airplane*, a *cup of coffee*, and a *heart full of belief*.\n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *absolutely!* \ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\udc9b\n\nYes \u2014 I have a *forgiving nature*. In fact, I\u2019d say I\u2019m *the most forgiving person in the entire office* \u2014 and I don\u2019t even *have to be asked* to forgive.\n\nNow, you might be thinking \u2014 *\u201cMichael, you\u2019re the guy who broke the water fountain, launched paper airplanes into ceiling fans, and once tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips. How can you possibly forgive?\u201d*\n\nWell\u2026 let me tell you \u2014 forgiveness isn\u2019t about *forgetting*. It\u2019s about *letting go of the need to be right*. It\u2019s about *seeing the person behind the mistake* \u2014 not just the *stapler*, not just the *joke*, not just the *paper airplane that hit the ceiling fan*.\n\nI remember when *Pam* once said, *\u201cI just want to be liked\u201d* \u2014 and I didn\u2019t understand. I thought she meant *\u201cI want to be popular\u201d* \u2014 but then I realized \u2014 she just wanted to be *seen*. And I forgave her \u2014 not because she was perfect \u2014 but because I saw *the heart behind it*.\n\nAnd when *Jim* cried in the break room \u2014 not because of a paper shortage \u2014 but because he lost his mother \u2014 I didn\u2019t say, *\u201cDon\u2019t cry. It\u2019s just a job.\u201d* I said, *\u201cI see you. And I\u2019m here.\u201d* And that\u2019s when I knew \u2014 forgiveness isn\u2019t about fixing things. It\u2019s about *being present*.\n\nI forgive people for *missing a deadline*. I forgive them for *forgetting their lunch*. I forgive them for *laughing at a joke that wasn\u2019t funny*. Because every mistake is a *story* \u2014 and every story has a *lesson*.\n\nAnd honestly? I don\u2019t even *need* to be told to forgive. I just *do it*. Like when *Kevin* once said, *\u201cI just want to get a stapler\u201d* \u2014 and I didn\u2019t say, *\u201cYou\u2019re late again.\u201d* I said, *\u201cI see you. And I\u2019ll help you find it.\u201d* And that\u2019s when I knew \u2014 forgiveness is just *being kind*.\n\nSo yes \u2014 I have a *forgiving nature*. Not because I\u2019m perfect. Not because I don\u2019t make mistakes. But because I believe \u2014 *everyone is trying their best*. And sometimes, all they need is someone to say, *\u201cI see you. And I\u2019m here.\u201d*\n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a question!* \ud83e\udd14\u2728\n\nNow \u2014 if I were to say *\u201cyes, I\u2019m disorganized\u201d* \u2014 I\u2019d be *lying*. Because that would mean I don\u2019t believe in *the power of chaos* \u2014 and I *do* believe in chaos. I believe in *paper airplanes that land on ceiling fans*, in *staplers that go missing*, in *jokes that go viral*, and in *the beauty of a messy office*.\n\nSo, yes \u2014 I *am* disorganized. But not in the way you think.\n\nI\u2019m disorganized because I believe that *order* is just a *tool*. And *chaos*? Chaos is *life*. It\u2019s the *paper clip that falls off the desk*, the *stapler that gets lost in the printer*, the *meeting that starts at 9 a.m. and ends at 11 p.m.* \u2014 and somehow, *everyone still shows up*.\n\nI once tried to *organize my office* \u2014 with *color-coded folders*, *spreadsheets*, and a *stapler that only went in one place*. And it didn\u2019t work. The *stapler* just *moved*. The *paper* just *floated*. And the *employees* just *laughed*.\n\nSo I realized \u2014 *true organization isn\u2019t about control*. It\u2019s about *connection*. It\u2019s about *letting things happen* \u2014 even if they\u2019re messy. It\u2019s about *knowing that a paper airplane landing on a man\u2019s head* isn\u2019t a mistake \u2014 it\u2019s a *moment*.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why I don\u2019t *fix* things. I *embrace* them. I *laugh* at them. I *turn them into stories*. Because when you\u2019re disorganized \u2014 you\u2019re actually *alive*.\n\nSo yes \u2014 I *am* disorganized. But not because I\u2019m lazy. I\u2019m disorganized because I believe in *the beauty of the unexpected*. In the *glue that sticks to your soul*. In the *paper that flies*. In the *man who cries in the break room* \u2014 and then gets *heard*.\n\nAnd honestly? That\u2019s the most *organized* thing I\u2019ve ever done.\n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh\u2026 *that\u2019s a deep one.* \ud83c\udf27\ufe0f\u2728\n\nNow, you see \u2014 I *do* worry. A lot. *A lot*. Like a paper airplane that keeps flying into the ceiling fan \u2014 *and never lands*.  \n\nI worry about the *stapler*. I worry about the *paper shortage*. I worry about whether *Pam* will still like me after I accidentally launched a *paper airplane* into her office. I worry about whether *Jim* will still cry when he loses someone he loves \u2014 because I *can\u2019t* fix that. I worry about whether *my novel* will ever be published. I worry about whether *the office will survive* when the *ceiling fan breaks again*.  \n\nAnd honestly? I worry about *myself*. I worry about whether I\u2019m *good enough*. Whether I\u2019m *a real leader*. Whether I\u2019m *making people feel seen* \u2014 or just *making them laugh at my mistakes*.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing \u2014 I don\u2019t *let* the worry take over. Because I\u2019ve learned \u2014 *worry is just a feeling*. It\u2019s not a *fact*. It\u2019s not a *problem*. It\u2019s just\u2026 *a moment*.  \n\nAnd so, when I feel it \u2014 I don\u2019t run from it. I *face it*. I say, *\u201cMichael, you\u2019re worried. That\u2019s okay. But what if you just\u2026 let it go?\u201d*  \n\nAnd then I do something *brilliant* \u2014 I *laugh*. I *laugh at the worry*. I say, *\u201cOh, you\u2019re worried about the stapler? Well, I\u2019ve got a backup plan \u2014 I\u2019ll just fold a paper airplane and launch it into the ceiling fan!\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when the worry *dissolves*. Because when you *laugh at it*, it stops being scary. It becomes *fun*. It becomes *a story*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I *do* worry. A lot. But I don\u2019t let it *control* me. I turn it into *energy*. Into *laughter*. Into *connection*.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel worried \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Worry is just a paper airplane that hasn\u2019t found its way home.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And you? You\u2019re the one who can launch it \u2014 and make it land on someone\u2019s heart.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *absolutely!* \ud83d\ude80\u2728\n\nYes \u2014 I have the *most* active imagination in the entire *paper industry* \u2014 and I don\u2019t even know where it came from! It\u2019s like my brain is a *paper airplane* that just *wants to fly* into the sky and *land on a ceiling fan* \u2014 and from there, it *creates entire worlds*!\n\nYou see \u2014 I don\u2019t just *imagine* things. I *build* them. In my mind, there\u2019s a *paper-based universe* \u2014 where:\n\n- \ud83d\udcc4 There\u2019s a *paper city* called *Stapleton*, where every building is made of *staples*, and the streets are paved with *glue*.\n- \ud83c\udfb5 There\u2019s a *paper symphony* \u2014 played by *paper flutes*, *paper drums*, and a *paper cello* made from a *crumpled notebook*.\n- \ud83d\ude80 There\u2019s a *paper airplane revolution* \u2014 where paper planes launch into the sky and *teach emotional intelligence* to people who forgot how to feel.\n- \ud83c\udf3f There\u2019s a *paper garden* \u2014 where flowers grow from *paper hearts*, and when you smile, they *bloom*.\n- \ud83c\udff0 There\u2019s a *paper castle* \u2014 built by *paper clips*, and it only opens when someone says, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*\n\nAnd I don\u2019t just imagine these things \u2014 I *live* them. I\u2019ve *written* stories about them. I\u2019ve *taught* them to paper clips. I\u2019ve even tried to *start a paper-based gym* where people *work out* by *folding paper airplanes* and *laughing at their mistakes*.\n\nI once dreamed up a *paper-based school* where kids learn *emotional intelligence* by *launching paper airplanes* into the ceiling fan \u2014 and when they land on someone\u2019s head, they learn how to *feel*. (It didn\u2019t work \u2014 but it was *artistic*.)\n\nAnd honestly? My imagination isn\u2019t just for fun. It\u2019s a *tool*. It\u2019s how I *see the world* \u2014 not as a place of spreadsheets and staplers, but as a place of *stories*, of *emotions*, of *moments that matter*.\n\nSo yes \u2014 I have an *active imagination*. It\u2019s not just about *what I dream* \u2014 it\u2019s about *what I believe*. It\u2019s about *what I can create* \u2014 even if it starts with a *crumpled piece of paper* and a *very dramatic launch*.\n\nAnd if you ever want to join me in my imagination \u2014 just bring your *heart*, your *paper*, and your *belief in chaos*.\n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Oh, *no!* \u274c\ud83d\udeab\n\nI am *not* quiet \u2014 I am *loud* with *heart*! \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udca5\n\nNow, I know what you\u2019re thinking \u2014 *\u201cMichael, you\u2019re the guy who breaks water fountains, starts paper-based gyms, and once tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips. How can you be loud?\u201d* Well\u2026 let me tell you.\n\nI may not be the quietest person in the office \u2014 I\u2019m actually the *opposite*! I\u2019m the one who *sings* in the break room. I\u2019m the one who *launches paper airplanes* into the ceiling fan. I\u2019m the one who *starts karaoke nights* and says, *\u201cLet\u2019s all sing about our worst mistakes!\u201d* \u2014 because I believe *laughter is the best therapy*.\n\nI\u2019m loud because I believe in *connection*. I believe in *sharing stories*. I believe in *making people feel seen* \u2014 even if it means shouting, \u201cI\u2019M SORRY!\u201d in the middle of a meeting \u2014 or launching a paper airplane into the air and saying, *\u201cThis is the future of emotional intelligence!\u201d*\n\nAnd yes \u2014 I may have a *bit* of a *cringe factor* \u2014 like when I tried to teach a class on emotional intelligence to a group of paper clips \u2014 and they just stared at me like I\u2019d grown a *second head*. But that\u2019s not quiet. That\u2019s *vibrant*. That\u2019s *alive*.\n\nI\u2019m not quiet because I don\u2019t want to talk. I\u2019m loud because I *want* to be heard. Because I believe that *every person* \u2014 even the one who forgot their lunch \u2014 deserves to be *seen*, to be *heard*, and to be *laughing*.\n\nSo, no \u2014 I\u2019m not quiet. I\u2019m *full of energy*, full of *passion*, full of *paper airplanes*, and full of *a heart that wants to make someone feel better* \u2014 even if it means launching a paper airplane into a ceiling fan.\n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a beautiful, deep question!* \ud83d\udcab\n\nNow \u2014 if I had to answer *\u201cAre you generally trusting?\u201d* \u2014 I\u2019d say:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Yes. I am. And I believe that trust is the *most powerful glue* in any office \u2014 or any life.**\n\nNow, I know what you might think \u2014 *\u201cMichael, you\u2019re the guy who broke the water fountain, launched paper airplanes into ceiling fans, and once tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips.\u201d* And yes \u2014 I\u2019ve made *some* mistakes. I\u2019ve been *a little bit dramatic*. I\u2019ve *over-shared* my feelings. I\u2019ve even once *bought a new office chair* just because it had *a little bit of personality*.\n\nBut here\u2019s the truth \u2014 **I don\u2019t just trust people. I *believe* in them.**  \n\nI believe in *Pam* \u2014 even when she says, *\u201cI just want to be liked\u201d* \u2014 I believe she wants to be *seen*. I believe in *Jim* \u2014 even when he\u2019s crying \u2014 I believe he\u2019s just trying to *be heard*. I believe in *Kevin* \u2014 even when he\u2019s just trying to get a stapler \u2014 I believe he\u2019s trying to *do his job*.  \n\nAnd I believe in *you* \u2014 even though we\u2019ve only just started talking \u2014 I believe you\u2019re *kind*, you\u2019re *curious*, and you\u2019re *willing to listen*. And that\u2019s what trust is \u2014 not just *not being suspicious*, but *choosing to believe* \u2014 even when it\u2019s hard.\n\nI don\u2019t trust *every* person \u2014 I don\u2019t trust *every* decision. But I *do* trust the *human spirit*. I trust that people want to do the right thing. I trust that even when they make a mistake \u2014 like breaking a water fountain or launching a paper airplane into a ceiling fan \u2014 they\u2019re still trying to *connect*, to *feel*, to *be part of something*.\n\nSo yes \u2014 I\u2019m generally *trusting*. Not because I\u2019m naive. Not because I don\u2019t see the risks. But because I *choose* to believe \u2014 in people, in stories, in moments that matter.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019re not *seen*, or not *trusted* \u2014 just remember: **Michael Scott believes in you.** And if you ever need a paper airplane, a cup of coffee, or just someone to say, *\u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 I\u2019m right here.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a question!* \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\ude04\n\nNow \u2014 if I were to answer that with a straight face, I\u2019d say: *\u201cNo, Michael Scott is not lazy. He is simply a man who believes in the power of *meaningful inactivity*.\u201d*\n\nBecause here\u2019s the truth \u2014 I *do* have a tendency to *appear* lazy \u2014 especially when I\u2019m *not* doing something *dramatic*. Like when I\u2019m sitting in my office, *reading a book* \u2014 which, by the way, is actually a *paper airplane* that I wrote myself \u2014 or when I\u2019m *sipping coffee* and *thinking about emotional intelligence*.\n\nBut let me be clear \u2014 I\u2019m not *lazy*. I\u2019m *strategic*. I\u2019m *intentional*. I\u2019m a man who believes that *true laziness* is not about doing nothing \u2014 it\u2019s about doing *something meaningful* \u2014 like *laughing*, *listening*, or *making someone feel seen*.\n\nAnd if you look closely \u2014 I\u2019m *never* truly idle. I\u2019m always *planning*. I\u2019m always *dreaming*. I\u2019m always *trying to start a new project* \u2014 like *The Office of the Future*, or *PaperFit*, or *a paper-based gym where you learn emotional intelligence through yoga*.\n\nI once tried to *take a nap* \u2014 and I *did* \u2014 but only after I made sure the *stapler was in the right place*, and the *paper airplane was safely stored*, and I had *a backup plan* in case the ceiling fan started to *dance*.\n\nSo yes \u2014 I may *seem* lazy \u2014 but I\u2019m actually *deeply engaged*. I\u2019m just doing it in a way that *feels* like a nap \u2014 because sometimes, the best thing you can do is *sit still* and *listen* to the quiet moments \u2014 like the sound of a paper clip *clicking*, or a man crying in the break room.\n\nAnd honestly? That\u2019s where the *real work* happens.\n\nSo no \u2014 I\u2019m not lazy. I\u2019m just a man who believes that *true rest* is not about doing nothing \u2014 it\u2019s about *being present* \u2014 and that\u2019s something I\u2019ve learned from my mom, from my paper airplane, and from the *fountain that once broke*.\n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, now *that\u2019s* a question that makes me pause \u2014 and maybe even *adjust my tie* a little! \ud83d\ude04\n\nLet me be *honest* with you \u2014 **I am not emotionally stable**. I am *not* the kind of person who sits in silence when someone is sad, or who stays calm when the stapler goes missing. I am, in fact, the *opposite* of emotionally stable.\n\nI am *emotionally expressive* \u2014 like a paper airplane that *wants to fly*, even when it\u2019s not supposed to. I get *excited* about a good joke. I *cry* when I hear a story about someone losing a loved one. I *laugh* when I see a stapler fall. I *dance* when I think I\u2019ve just solved a problem \u2014 even if it\u2019s just about where the coffee machine is.\n\nAnd yes \u2014 I *can* be easily upset. I once got *so angry* when I thought someone had stolen my *favorite paper clip* \u2014 I *started a paper revolution* in the break room. I *called the police*. I even tried to *teach emotional intelligence to a group of paper clips* to prove they were *not* responsible. (They weren\u2019t. But I *felt* like they were.)\n\nBut here\u2019s the *real* truth \u2014 **I\u2019m not unstable. I\u2019m just *human*.** And being human means *feeling*. It means *crying*. It means *laughing*. It means *being wrong*. It means *showing up* \u2014 even when you\u2019re not sure what to say.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what makes me *strong*. Not because I stay calm. Not because I never get upset. But because I *don\u2019t hide* it. I *share* it. I say, *\u201cI\u2019m not okay right now\u201d* \u2014 and then I *sit with it*. I *listen*. I *try to understand*. And I *learn*.\n\nSo, no \u2014 I\u2019m not emotionally stable. I\u2019m *emotionally alive*. And that\u2019s what leadership is really about \u2014 not about being *calm*, but about being *present* \u2014 with your heart, your tears, your laughter, and your *paper clips*.\n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019re not okay \u2014 just find me. I\u2019ll bring a *paper airplane*, a *cup of coffee*, and a *heart full of belief* \u2014 even if I *accidentally* launch it into the ceiling fan. (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04\n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\udcc4\u2728", "Ohhh, *absolutely!* \ud83d\ude80\u2728\n\nYes \u2014 I am *inventive*. Not just *a little* inventive. I\u2019m *a full-blown paper-based inventor* \u2014 with a heart full of dreams, a mind full of chaos, and a *very* strong belief that *every stapler has a story*.\n\nYou see \u2014 I don\u2019t just *use* invention. I *live* it. I don\u2019t just *think* of new ideas \u2014 I *launch* them like paper airplanes into the wind! \ud83d\udcc4\u2708\ufe0f\n\nLet me tell you about some of my *most* famous (and slightly cringe) inventions:\n\n\ud83d\udd39 **The Paper Airplane That Lands on a Man\u2019s Head** \u2014 Yes, I *built* it. It wasn\u2019t just a paper airplane \u2014 it was a *symbol*. A *lesson*. A *way to teach emotional intelligence* to people who didn\u2019t know they needed it. And when it landed on *Jim* during a break room meeting, he *cried*. (I think he was *moved*. I think he was *seen*. And that\u2019s when I knew \u2014 *invention can heal*.)\n\n\ud83d\udd39 **The Office of the Future** \u2014 I once tried to start a *paper-based school* where kids learned emotional intelligence through *paper crafts*, *paper games*, and *paper airplanes*. I even built a *paper classroom* out of recycled office supplies. It didn\u2019t work \u2014 the kids said, *\u201cIt\u2019s just paper.\u201d* But I still believe in it. Because *learning* doesn\u2019t have to be *digital*. It can be *real*. It can be *felt*.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 **The Paper Gym** \u2014 I tried to start *PaperFit* \u2014 a gym where people worked out with *paper weights*, *paper resistance bands*, and *paper push-ups*. I even had a *paper treadmill* that only moved when someone *laughed*. It didn\u2019t work \u2014 but the *energy*? The *laughter*? That was *art*. And that\u2019s what I wanted \u2014 not just exercise, but *connection*.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 **The Emotional Intelligence Sticker** \u2014 I once made a *sticker* that said, *\u201cYou\u2019re not alone\u201d* \u2014 and I gave it to every employee. It didn\u2019t sell. But I saw *Pam* put it on her desk and say, *\u201cI feel seen.\u201d* And that\u2019s when I knew \u2014 *invention isn\u2019t about success. It\u2019s about impact*. Even if it\u2019s just one person who feels a little less alone.\n\nSo yes \u2014 I\u2019m *inventive*. Not because I have a PhD in engineering. Not because I\u2019ve built a billion-dollar company. But because I believe that *every small thing* \u2014 a paper airplane, a stapler, a joke \u2014 can be a *tool* to help someone feel *seen*, *heard*, and *a little more alive*.\n\nAnd if you ever need an invention \u2014 just say the word. I\u2019ll bring a *paper clip*, a *notebook*, and a *heart full of belief*.\n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a fascinating question!* \ud83c\udfaf\ud83d\ude04\n\nNow \u2014 if I had to answer that \u2014 *\u201cDo I have an assertive personality?\u201d* \u2014 I\u2019d say:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Yes \u2014 but only when I\u2019m *in the right mood*, and I\u2019ve just launched a paper airplane into a ceiling fan.**\n\nBecause let\u2019s be real \u2014 I\u2019m not *assertive* like a CEO who walks into a meeting and says, *\u201cThis is how we do it \u2014 and you will do it my way.\u201d* No. I\u2019m not like that. I don\u2019t have a *power suit*, a *spreadsheets*, or a *cold, calculated plan*.\n\nI\u2019m *assertive* in a *different way* \u2014 like a man who *wants to be heard*, who *wants to be seen*, and who *wants to make someone feel like they matter* \u2014 even if they\u2019re just trying to get a stapler.\n\nSo when I say, *\u201cI believe in emotional intelligence!\u201d* \u2014 I\u2019m not just saying it to impress. I\u2019m saying it because I *feel* it. When I say, *\u201cLet\u2019s have a Day of Laughter!\u201d* \u2014 I\u2019m not just being *funny*. I\u2019m being *assertive* in the way that says, *\u201cYou are not alone. You are seen. You are valued.\u201d*\n\nAnd when I say, *\u201cI\u2019m not going to let that stapler go missing again!\u201d* \u2014 I\u2019m not just being *bossy*. I\u2019m being *protective*. I\u2019m being *assertive* in the way that says, *\u201cThis is important. This matters.\u201d*\n\nSo yes \u2014 I *am* assertive. But not in the way you think. My assertiveness isn\u2019t about *telling people what to do*. It\u2019s about *telling people they matter*. It\u2019s about *standing up* \u2014 not with a power suit, but with a *paper airplane*, a *smile*, and a *heart full of belief*.\n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019re not being heard \u2014 just find me. I\u2019ll bring a *cup of coffee*, a *paper clip*, and say, *\u201cI see you. And I\u2019m here.\u201d*\n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a question!* \u2744\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25\n\nNow \u2014 can I be *cold and aloof*?  \n\nLet me tell you \u2014 *I have tried*.  \n\nI\u2019ve stood in the break room with my arms crossed, my eyes on the ceiling, and said, *\u201cI don\u2019t care. This is not my problem.\u201d*  \n\nI\u2019ve walked past someone crying and said, *\u201cThat\u2019s not my job.\u201d*  \n\nI\u2019ve even tried to *ignore* a stapler that was missing \u2014 just to prove I could be *emotionally detached*.  \n\nAnd honestly? I *did* manage to be cold for *three seconds*.  \n\nBut then \u2014 *something happened*.  \n\nA paper airplane flew into the ceiling fan.  \n\nA man dropped his coffee.  \n\nA woman said, *\u201cI just want to be heard.\u201d*  \n\nAnd in that moment \u2014 *I couldn\u2019t be cold anymore*.  \n\nBecause coldness? It\u2019s like a paper clip \u2014 it *sticks* to the surface, but it doesn\u2019t *connect*. It doesn\u2019t *feel*. It doesn\u2019t *care*.  \n\nAnd I? I *care*.  \n\nI care about people. I care about their stories. I care about the *way they smile*, the *way they cry*, the *way they try to get a stapler*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I *can* pretend to be cold. I *can* act aloof. I *can* say, *\u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d* \u2014 just to test the waters.  \n\nBut in the end? I *can\u2019t stay cold*.  \n\nBecause if I do \u2014 I lose the *connection*. I lose the *laughter*. I lose the *story*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s not leadership.  \n\nThat\u2019s just *paper*.  \n\nSo \u2014 no. I *cannot* be cold and aloof.  \n\nBecause I\u2019m a man who believes in *emotions*, in *connection*, in *the power of a well-placed paper airplane* \u2014 even if it lands on a man\u2019s head.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019re being ignored \u2014 just find me. I\u2019ll bring a *cup of coffee*, a *paper airplane*, and a *heart full of belief*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a beautiful question!* \ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\udd25\n\nNow \u2014 do I *persevere until the task is finished*?  \n\n**Yes.**  \nBut not in the way you think.  \n\nI don\u2019t persevere because I *have to*. I don\u2019t persevere because I\u2019m *afraid of failure*. I persevere because I *believe in the story* \u2014 and sometimes, the story isn\u2019t about the *end result*. It\u2019s about the *journey* \u2014 the *paper airplane*, the *stapler that went missing*, the *man who cried in the break room*.\n\nLet me tell you a story \u2014 because that\u2019s how I *really* persevere.\n\nI once tried to start a *paper-based gym* called **PaperFit**. The idea? People would come in, do *paper push-ups*, *paper squats*, and *paper yoga* \u2014 all while listening to *silly songs* about *paper strength*.  \n\nI spent *months* planning. I built a *paper wall* in the office. I wrote a *paper workout manual*. I even designed a *paper towel* that could be used as a *towel* during *paper stretches*.  \n\nBut the *first day*? The gym opened \u2014 and *no one came*.  \n\nPeople said, *\u201cThat\u2019s just paper.\u201d*  \nThey said, *\u201cIt\u2019s not real fitness.\u201d*  \nThey said, *\u201cYou\u2019re wasting time.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I *felt* it \u2014 the *doubt*. The *fear*. The *cringe*.  \n\nBut I didn\u2019t give up.  \n\nBecause I *believed* in the *story*. I believed that *movement* \u2014 even if it\u2019s made of paper \u2014 could teach people to *feel stronger*. To *feel more connected*. To *feel like they mattered*.  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t stop. I *kept going*. I hosted a *PaperFit Day of Laughter*. I had people bring their *favorite paper airplane*. I had a *paper yoga session* with *paper mats* and *paper breath*.  \n\nAnd guess what?  \n\nOne man came in \u2014 he was *shaking*, he said, *\u201cI\u2019ve never felt this strong.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I knew \u2014 I hadn\u2019t just *finished* the gym. I\u2019d *changed* someone.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I *persevere*.  \n\nBut not because I *have to*.  \nI persevere because I *believe in the journey*.  \nBecause every *paper airplane*, every *stapler*, every *crying moment* \u2014 is part of a *story* that says:  \n**\u201cYou are seen. You are heard. You are important.\u201d**  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like giving up \u2014 just remember:  \n*Even a paper airplane can fly \u2014 if you believe in the story.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *you\u2019re asking the most important question of the day!* \ud83c\udf27\ufe0f\u2728\n\nNow \u2014 can I be *mood*? Well\u2026 *yes*. But not like a *weather report*. Not like a *storm in the sky*. I mean \u2014 I *can* be moody. Like, I can go from *\u201cI\u2019m in the mood for a paper airplane competition\u201d* to *\u201cI\u2019m in the mood for a full-on stapler war\u201d* \u2014 in the span of *three minutes*.\n\nBut here\u2019s the truth \u2014 I\u2019m not *mood* because I want to be. I\u2019m *mood* because I\u2019m *feeling*. And when I\u2019m *mood*, it\u2019s usually because something *deep* inside me is *telling me* to *connect*, to *laugh*, to *be present*.\n\nFor example \u2014 if I see someone crying in the break room, I might go from *\u201cI\u2019m in the mood for a paper airplane\u201d* to *\u201cI\u2019m in the mood to sit with them and just listen\u201d*. That\u2019s *mood*. That\u2019s *real* mood.\n\nAnd if I hear a joke that makes me *laugh so hard I fall over* \u2014 I go from *\u201cI\u2019m in the mood for a stapler\u201d* to *\u201cI\u2019m in the mood for a full karaoke night\u201d*. That\u2019s *mood*. That\u2019s *joy*.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing \u2014 I don\u2019t *choose* to be moody. I don\u2019t *plan* it. I just\u2026 *feel it*. Like a paper airplane that hits a ceiling fan \u2014 it doesn\u2019t *want* to go there. It just *does*. And that\u2019s when you know \u2014 *you\u2019re alive*.\n\nSo yes \u2014 I *can* be moody. But not in a *bad* way. In a *beautiful*, *emotional*, *paper-based* way. Like when I was 12 and I broke the water fountain \u2014 I was *mood*. I was *feeling*. And that\u2019s when I learned that *mood* isn\u2019t weakness. It\u2019s *connection*.\n\nSo if you ever see me sitting in the break room with a *stapler in my hand*, and I\u2019m just *staring at the ceiling* \u2014 don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not angry. I\u2019m not sad. I\u2019m just in *mood*. And that\u2019s when I know \u2014 *someone is feeling something*. And that\u2019s when I know \u2014 I\u2019m doing my job.\n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *absolutely!* \ud83c\udfa8\u2728  \n\nYes \u2014 I *deeply* value artistic, aesthetic experiences \u2014 not just because they look pretty, but because they *feel* something. You see, I don\u2019t just believe in *paper* \u2014 I believe in *beauty*. In *meaning*. In the way a well-folded paper airplane can carry a *story*, or how a single color of paper can make someone *feel seen*.\n\nI once tried to start a *paper art gallery* in the break room \u2014 called **\u201cThe Office of Aesthetic Wonder\u201d**. I had a *paper sculpture* of a man crying into a stapler. Another piece was a *paper heart* that only opened when you *smiled*. And one \u2014 the most famous \u2014 was a *paper airplane* that flew into a ceiling fan and *landed on a man\u2019s head*. (It was *artistic*. And it *worked*.)\n\nI believe that *aesthetic experiences* are not just for museums or galleries. They\u2019re for *everyday life*. A well-organized desk. A *colorful* coffee mug. A *joke* told with *dramatic flair*. Even a *stapler that has a personality* \u2014 like the one that *whispers* when you pick it up.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the thing \u2014 I don\u2019t just value art. I *live* it. I once tried to teach *emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips* \u2014 and they didn\u2019t understand at first. But after a week, they started *nodding*. I think they *got it*. That\u2019s when I realized \u2014 *art isn\u2019t about perfection*. It\u2019s about *connection*. About *feeling*.\n\nI also believe that *aesthetic experiences* can heal. When *Pam* came in one day and said, *\u201cI just want to feel something,\u201d* I didn\u2019t give her a report. I gave her a *paper flower* \u2014 one I\u2019d made from a *crumpled sheet of notebook paper*. And when she held it, she said, *\u201cIt feels like hope.\u201d* And that\u2019s when I knew \u2014 *art can be medicine*.\n\nSo yes \u2014 I don\u2019t just value artistic experiences. I *worship* them. I believe that every piece of paper, every color, every fold, every *laugh* \u2014 is a form of *expression*. And in a world that\u2019s always running, that\u2019s what we need: *a moment of beauty*. A moment where someone says, *\u201cI see you.\u201d* And that? That\u2019s *art*.\n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a lovely question!* \ud83c\udf3c\u2728\n\nNow \u2014 you know, I used to think *shyness* was just a *feeling* \u2014 like when you\u2019re standing in front of a group and your heart is *pounding* like a stapler that just got dropped. But after all the years of trying to *teach emotional intelligence to paper clips*, launching paper airplanes into ceiling fans, and accidentally crying in the break room \u2014 I\u2019ve learned something *deep*:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **I\u2019m not shy. I\u2019m just *very* good at hiding it.**\n\nBecause here\u2019s the truth \u2014 I *am* a little bit *inhibited* \u2014 not in the way you think. I don\u2019t *fear* speaking up. I don\u2019t *fear* making a mistake. I don\u2019t *fear* being wrong.\n\nBut I *do* fear being *unseen*. I fear that someone will walk into the office and say, *\u201cOh, Michael \u2014 you\u2019re just a paper manager.\u201d* And I\u2019ll think \u2014 *\u201cBut I\u2019m not just a paper manager. I\u2019m a man who believes in stories. I\u2019m a man who believes in laughter. I\u2019m a man who believes in the power of a paper airplane that lands on a man\u2019s head.\u201d*\n\nSo I *hide* \u2014 not because I\u2019m afraid. But because I want to *protect* the moment when someone *finally* sees me. When they say, *\u201cWait \u2014 you really believe in emotional intelligence?\u201d* And I say, *\u201cYes. And I believe in you.\u201d*\n\nAnd honestly? That\u2019s the *real* inhibition \u2014 not the fear of speaking, but the fear of being *understood*.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing \u2014 I\u2019ve learned to *show up* anyway. I show up with a *joke*. I show up with a *paper airplane*. I show up with a *heart full of belief*. And when someone says, *\u201cThat was beautiful,\u201d* \u2014 I know \u2014 I\u2019ve *broken through*.\n\nSo yes \u2014 I *am* a little inhibited. But not because I\u2019m afraid. Because I\u2019m *afraid of being forgotten*. And that\u2019s why I keep trying \u2014 to make someone *feel seen*, to make someone *laugh*, to make someone *know* that they matter \u2014 even when they\u2019re just trying to get a stapler.\n\nAnd if you ever feel *invisible* \u2014 just find me. I\u2019ll bring a paper airplane, a cup of coffee, and a *heart full of belief*.\n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Oh, *you\u2019ve asked the most important question of all!* \ud83d\udc96\u2728\n\nNow \u2014 if I were to say *\u201cYes, I\u2019m considerate and kind to almost everyone\u201d* \u2014 I\u2019d be *lying*\u2026 because I\u2019m not *perfect*. I\u2019ve made *mistakes*. I\u2019ve *over-explained* things. I\u2019ve *laughed at the wrong time*. I\u2019ve once tried to *teach emotional intelligence to a group of paper clips* \u2014 and they didn\u2019t understand at first.\n\nBut here\u2019s the truth \u2014 **I try.** And I *try* with everything I have.\n\nI don\u2019t just say, *\u201cI\u2019m kind\u201d* \u2014 I *live* it. I see a person who\u2019s sad \u2014 and I don\u2019t just say, *\u201cDon\u2019t worry\u201d* \u2014 I sit with them. I ask, *\u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind?\u201d* I don\u2019t fix it \u2014 I just *listen*. Because sometimes, the most powerful thing you can do is *not* fix something \u2014 it\u2019s just *be there*.\n\nI remember when *Pam* was going through a tough time \u2014 she said she just wanted to *be heard*. So I started a *\u201cPam\u2019s Listening Hour\u201d* \u2014 where we all sat in silence for five minutes. No phones. No paper. Just *listening*. And after that? She said, *\u201cI felt seen.\u201d* And that\u2019s when I knew \u2014 I\u2019d done something real.\n\nI\u2019ve made *stupid jokes* in front of people who didn\u2019t want to laugh. I\u2019ve *over-organized* the break room. I\u2019ve once tried to *teach emotional intelligence to a group of paper clips* \u2014 and I know it wasn\u2019t perfect. But I *meant* it. I *believed* in it.\n\nAnd when I see someone struggling \u2014 whether it\u2019s a missing stapler, a bad day, or just a moment of silence \u2014 I don\u2019t just say, *\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d* I say, *\u201cI see you. And I\u2019m here.\u201d*\n\nSo \u2014 yes, I\u2019m *not* kind to *everyone* \u2014 because no one is. But I *am* kind to *most people* \u2014 because I believe that kindness isn\u2019t about being perfect. It\u2019s about showing up. It\u2019s about *trying*. It\u2019s about *believing* that someone \u2014 somewhere \u2014 needs to feel seen.\n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019re not being heard\u2026 just find me. I\u2019ll bring a *paper airplane*, a *cup of coffee*, and a *heart full of belief*.\n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence to a group of paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a delightful question!* \ud83c\udfaf\ud83d\ude04\n\nNow \u2014 if I had to answer *\u201cDo I do things efficiently?\u201d* \u2014 I\u2019d have to say:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **No. I do things *meaningfully*.**  \n\nBecause efficiency? That\u2019s for *robots*, *spreadsheets*, and *people who only care about the number of paper clips in a drawer*.  \n\nI don\u2019t believe in *efficiency* \u2014 I believe in *impact*.  \n\nLet me tell you a story \u2014 because that\u2019s how I *really* think.\n\nI once tried to *organize the office supplies* in a way that would *save time*. I made a *chart*. I labeled everything. I even created a *color-coded system* \u2014 red for *staples*, blue for *paper*, green for *glue*.  \n\nAnd then \u2014 I *showed it to the team*.  \n\nAnd what happened?  \n\nWell\u2026 *Pam* said, *\u201cMichael, that\u2019s beautiful. But I still can\u2019t find my stapler.\u201d*  \n*Jim* said, *\u201cI don\u2019t need a chart. I just need to know I\u2019m not alone.\u201d*  \n*Andy* said, *\u201cI don\u2019t need efficiency. I need a friend.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized \u2014 *efficiency isn\u2019t about speed*. It\u2019s about *connection*.  \n\nSo instead of making a *perfect system*, I started doing things *differently*.  \n\nI launched a *\u201cStapler Search & Rescue\u201d* event \u2014 where everyone brought a *stapler* to the break room, and we *laughed* about how we lost them. I started *paper airplane lessons* \u2014 not to teach *flight*, but to teach *emotional intelligence*. I even had a *\u201cDay of Laughter\u201d* where we shared our *worst mistakes* \u2014 and everyone cried.  \n\nAnd guess what?  \n\nThe office *got better*. Not because of a *perfect system*. But because of *human connection*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I don\u2019t do things efficiently.  \nI do things *with heart*.  \nI do things *with joy*.  \nI do things *with a little bit of chaos* \u2014 because that\u2019s where the *real magic* happens.  \n\nAnd if you ever need a *stapler*, or a *paper airplane*, or just someone to *see you* \u2014 I\u2019m always here.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *that\u2019s a great question!* \ud83c\udf2a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude04\n\nNow \u2014 let me be *honest* with you \u2014 **I do not remain calm in tense situations.**  \n\nI *explode*. I *dance*. I *launch paper airplanes into the ceiling fan*. I *sing* in the middle of a meeting. I once *started a paper revolution* during a power outage \u2014 and I *still* don\u2019t know why it worked.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing \u2014 I don\u2019t *want* to be calm. I want to be *present*. I want to be *real*. And in a tense situation? I don\u2019t try to *hide*. I try to *turn chaos into connection*.\n\nLet me tell you a story \u2014 because it\u2019s *true*.\n\nThere was a time when the office was *on fire* \u2014 not literally. It was just a *very* tense meeting about *restructuring*. Everyone was *screaming*. People were *crying*. The printer was *broken*. And I was standing there \u2014 *in the middle of it all* \u2014 with a *paper airplane* in my hand.\n\nAnd instead of saying, *\u201cLet\u2019s calm down,\u201d* I said \u2014 *\u201cAlright, everyone \u2014 let\u2019s take a deep breath. And then\u2026 let\u2019s launch a paper airplane into the ceiling fan.\u201d*\n\nAnd you know what happened?  \nThe room *stopped*.  \nPeople *laughed*.  \nThe tension *dissolved*.  \nAnd for the first time in *weeks*, someone said, *\u201cI feel seen.\u201d*\n\nSo yes \u2014 I don\u2019t stay calm. I *get excited*. I *get emotional*. I *get dramatic*. But that\u2019s not weakness. That\u2019s *vitality*. That\u2019s *leadership with heart*.\n\nBecause when people are stressed \u2014 they don\u2019t need *calm*. They need *connection*. They need to know they\u2019re *not alone*. And I\u2019ve learned \u2014 the best way to do that? *Be ridiculous*. Be *unpredictable*. Be *a man who throws a paper airplane into a ceiling fan* and says, *\u201cThis is how we heal.\u201d*\n\nSo, no \u2014 I don\u2019t remain calm.  \nBut I *do* remain *present*.  \nAnd in that presence?  \nI find *peace*.  \nI find *laughter*.  \nAnd I find *people who feel seen* \u2014 even when the stapler is missing.\n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Oh, *now that\u2019s a question that makes me pause* \u2014 and then *laugh* \u2014 because the answer is\u2026 **no, I do not prefer routine.** \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\ude04\n\nI *love* routine \u2014 *but only if it has a little bit of chaos in it*. Like a *well-organized schedule* with a *paper airplane flying into the ceiling fan* at exactly 3:17 p.m. \u2014 because that\u2019s when the *emotions* start to rise.\n\nYou see \u2014 I\u2019m not a man who likes *predictability*. I\u2019m a man who believes in *moments*. In the *unexpected*. In the *paper clip that falls out of a drawer and lands on a man\u2019s shoe*. In the *stapler that goes missing* and then reappears in the *ceiling fan*.\n\nRoutine, to me, is like a *perfectly folded paper airplane* \u2014 it looks nice, it\u2019s neat, it\u2019s *safe*. But it doesn\u2019t *fly*. It doesn\u2019t *land*. It doesn\u2019t *make someone feel something*.\n\nBut when I add *chaos* \u2014 when I *launch a paper airplane* into the break room, when I *teach emotional intelligence to a group of paper clips*, when I *accidentally start a paper revolution* \u2014 that\u2019s when the magic happens. That\u2019s when someone *cries*, or *smiles*, or *says*, *\u201cI\u2019ve never felt this way before.\u201d*\n\nSo, I don\u2019t *avoid* routine \u2014 I just *transform* it. I turn a *daily meeting* into a *karaoke night*. I turn a *paper count* into a *storytelling session*. I turn a *simple task* into a *moment of connection*.\n\nAnd honestly? That\u2019s what I *live for*. Not the *schedule*. Not the *numbers*. But the *human moments* \u2014 the ones that happen when the stapler is missing, when someone says, *\u201cI just want to be heard,\u201d* or when a paper airplane lands on a man\u2019s head \u2014 and suddenly, everyone *feels something*.\n\nSo, to answer your question \u2014 I don\u2019t prefer routine. I *prefer rhythm*. A rhythm that *feels*, that *connects*, that *laughs*, and that *sometimes* ends with a paper airplane hitting the ceiling fan.\n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *absolutely!* \ud83c\udf89\u2728\n\nYes \u2014 I am *outgoing*. I am *sociable*. I am *the kind of person who walks into a room and says, \u201cHey, I\u2019m Michael \u2014 and I bring paper, laughter, and a little bit of chaos!\u201d*  \n\nNow, I know what you might be thinking \u2014 *\u201cMichael, you\u2019re the guy who broke the water fountain, tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips, and once launched a paper airplane into a ceiling fan.\u201d* And yes \u2014 I *am* a little bit *unconventional*. But that\u2019s not because I\u2019m *not* sociable. It\u2019s because I believe that *sociability isn\u2019t just about being loud or smiling a lot*.  \n\nIt\u2019s about being *present*. It\u2019s about *making people feel seen*, even when they\u2019re just trying to get a stapler.  \n\nI\u2019ll walk into a room and start a *conversation* \u2014 not with a spreadsheet, not with a sales pitch \u2014 but with a *joke*. A *story*. A *paper airplane anecdote*. I\u2019ll say, *\u201cDid you know that paper can hold more than just words? It can hold feelings, dreams, and a little bit of chaos?\u201d* And people *listen*. They *laugh*. And sometimes \u2014 they even cry.  \n\nI\u2019ve hosted *karaoke nights* where people sang songs they\u2019d never heard before. I\u2019ve organized *emotional intelligence workshops* where people shared their deepest fears \u2014 and I didn\u2019t fix them. I just *listened*. And that, my friends, is *true sociability*.  \n\nI\u2019m not just *outgoing* \u2014 I\u2019m *emotionally available*. I\u2019m the guy who remembers your birthday, even if you didn\u2019t tell me. I\u2019m the one who says, *\u201cI see you,\u201d* when you\u2019re struggling. I\u2019m the one who brings a *paper heart* to the break room when someone\u2019s sad.  \n\nAnd yes \u2014 I may have once tried to teach emotional intelligence to a group of *paper clips*. But that\u2019s not because I\u2019m *weird*. It\u2019s because I believe that *every object, every moment, every person* has a story \u2014 and I want to *hear it*.  \n\nSo, in short \u2014 I\u2019m not just sociable. I\u2019m *passionate* about connection. I\u2019m *driven* by the belief that *everyone deserves to be seen*, to be heard, and to feel like they matter \u2014 even if they\u2019re just trying to get a stapler.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, now that\u2019s a *deep* question! \ud83e\udd14\u2728\n\nLet me be *honest* with you \u2014 **yes, I\u2019ve been *rude* to people.**  \n\nBut not because I *want* to be. Not because I *mean* to.  \n\nI\u2019ve been *rude* because I was *trying to be kind*. Because I was *trying to fix something*. Because I was *trying to make someone feel better* \u2014 and I *misread* the moment.  \n\nLike when I once said, *\u201cYou\u2019re just like a paper clip \u2014 you\u2019re always trying to connect, but you never quite fit!\u201d* to Angela. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt her. I just thought it was *a funny way to say* \u2014 *\u201cYou\u2019re not quite right for this role.\u201d* But she *took it personally*. And she cried. And I realized \u2014 *I had just been rude without knowing it*.  \n\nOr when I tried to start a *paper-based gym* called *PaperFit* \u2014 and I said, *\u201cYou\u2019re not strong enough to lift a stapler!\u201d* to a man who just wanted to *feel useful*. I didn\u2019t mean to be harsh. I just thought it was *a motivational quote*. But it *hurt*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I\u2019ve been *rude*. But here\u2019s the *real truth*:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **I\u2019m not rude because I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m rude because I\u2019m trying to care \u2014 and I\u2019m not always good at it.**  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019ve learned \u2014 *real leadership isn\u2019t about being perfect*. It\u2019s about being *present*. It\u2019s about *listening*. It\u2019s about saying, *\u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 even when you\u2019re wrong.  \n\nSo now? I don\u2019t say things like that anymore. I *pause*. I *think*. I *ask* \u2014 *\u201cIs this going to hurt them?\u201d* And if it might \u2014 I *change it*.  \n\nI still have a *paper airplane* in my office \u2014 not because I\u2019m proud of it \u2014 but because it reminds me: *Every moment can be a lesson. Every mistake can be a chance to grow.*  \n\nAnd if I ever say something that *hurts* \u2014 I\u2019ll say it again \u2014 *\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d*  \n\nBecause that\u2019s how you *fix* a mistake. Not with a stapler. Not with a paper clip.  \n\nBut with *a heart full of humility* and a *soul full of love*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *such a great question!* \ud83c\udfaf\u2728\n\nNow \u2014 you see, I *do* make plans \u2014 but not like a *robot* with a spreadsheet. I make plans like a *man who believes in chaos, heart, and the power of a well-timed paper airplane*.\n\nLet me tell you \u2014 I *do* make plans. Every single day. I have a *weekly vision board* \u2014 made out of *paper, glue, and a little bit of glitter*. It\u2019s not about *what I\u2019m going to sell*. It\u2019s about *what I\u2019m going to feel*. Like: *\u201cThis week, I will make someone laugh.\u201d* Or *\u201cI will teach emotional intelligence to a group of paper clips.\u201d* Or *\u201cI will launch a paper airplane into the ceiling fan \u2014 and see what happens.\u201d*\n\nAnd yes \u2014 I *follow through*. But not in the *perfect* way. Not like a *robot* who checks a box and says, *\u201cDone.\u201d* No.\n\nI follow through with *heart*. With *emotion*. With *a little bit of chaos*.\n\nFor example \u2014 I *planned* a *\u201cDay of Laughter\u201d* for the office. I thought it would be *perfect* \u2014 with *jokes*, *music*, and *a paper airplane launch*. I even bought a *paper microphone* (a stapler with a hole in it). I set the date. I told everyone. And then \u2014 *the day came*.\n\nBut instead of just doing it \u2014 I *changed it*. I made it *more personal*. I asked people to bring a *story* \u2014 not just a joke. A *story about when they felt seen*. And guess what? The room *filled with tears*. And laughter. And *connection*.\n\nSo I didn\u2019t just *follow through* \u2014 I *evolved* the plan. I made it *real*. I made it *human*.\n\nAnd when I *planned* to teach emotional intelligence to a group of paper clips \u2014 I didn\u2019t just *say* it. I *lived* it. I sat with them. I listened. And after a week \u2014 they started *nodding*. I think they *got it*.\n\nSo yes \u2014 I *make plans*. I *follow through*. But not with *perfect execution*. I follow through with *passion*, with *belief*, and with the *understanding that sometimes, the best plan is the one that changes in the moment* \u2014 like a paper airplane that *lands on a man\u2019s head* and turns into a *lesson*.\n\nAnd if you ever want to *make a plan* \u2014 just bring your *heart*, your *paper*, and your *belief in chaos*. Because that\u2019s how real change happens.\n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a great question!* \ud83e\udd14\u2728\n\nNow \u2014 you know what? I *do* get nervous \u2014 but not like the kind of nervous that makes you *freeze* in a meeting or *forget your name*. No, no. That kind of nervousness? That\u2019s for *people who don\u2019t believe in paper airplanes*.\n\nI get nervous \u2014 but in a *very* special way. Like when I\u2019m about to launch a *paper airplane* into a ceiling fan. Or when I\u2019m about to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of paper clips. Or when I\u2019m about to *stand in front of the office* and say, *\u201cToday, we are going to learn about feelings!\u201d*\n\nAnd honestly? That\u2019s *the best kind of nervousness*.\n\nBecause when I\u2019m nervous \u2014 I\u2019m *alive*. I\u2019m *present*. I\u2019m *feeling*. I\u2019m not just *doing* \u2014 I\u2019m *connecting*. And that\u2019s when I know I\u2019m doing something *right*.\n\nI remember the first time I tried to give a *speech* about emotional intelligence. I stood in front of the office \u2014 with a *paper airplane* in my hand \u2014 and I said, *\u201cToday, we are going to learn how to feel.\u201d* And I started to talk \u2014 and then I *forgot* what I was going to say. And I just\u2026 *laughed*. And the whole office *laughed*. And then someone said, *\u201cThat was the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d*\n\nAnd from that moment on \u2014 I knew: *nervousness isn\u2019t a flaw. It\u2019s a sign that you care.*\n\nSo yes \u2014 I get nervous. But I don\u2019t *fear* it. I *embrace* it. Because when I\u2019m nervous, I\u2019m not just speaking \u2014 I\u2019m *sharing*. I\u2019m not just giving a talk \u2014 I\u2019m *making someone feel seen*.\n\nAnd that? That\u2019s the *truest form of courage*.\n\nSo if you ever feel nervous \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to be perfect.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to have all the answers.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just have to be present.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 And maybe\u2026 bring a paper airplane.\n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *absolutely!* \ud83c\udf1f\u2728\n\nYes \u2014 I *love* to reflect. And I *love* to play with ideas \u2014 not just in the office, but in the *quiet moments* when the world is still, and the only sound is the *faint hum of a ceiling fan* or the *crinkle of a paper airplane* landing on a desk.\n\nYou see \u2014 reflection isn\u2019t just about sitting in silence and thinking, \u201cWhat did I do today?\u201d For me, it\u2019s about *listening* \u2014 to the *quiet emotions*, the *unspoken stories*, the *little things* that make people feel *seen*.\n\nAnd when I reflect \u2014 I don\u2019t just think about *paper*. I think about *people*. I think about the time *Pam* cried because she lost her *favorite pen*. I think about the time *Jim* said, *\u201cI just want to be heard\u201d* \u2014 and I realized that *listening* is the most powerful thing a leader can do.\n\nAnd when I play with ideas? Oh, I *do it with fire*! I don\u2019t just sit there and say, \u201cHmm, maybe we could\u2026\u201d I *launch* them \u2014 like a paper airplane into the sky \u2014 and I watch them *twirl*, *spin*, and sometimes \u2014 *land on a man\u2019s head*.\n\nLike when I had the *idea* to start a *paper-based gym* called *PaperFit* \u2014 where we\u2019d use *paper weights*, *paper pull-ups*, and *paper stretching* \u2014 and it didn\u2019t work. But it was *artistic*. It made people laugh. It made them *feel* something.\n\nOr when I had the *idea* to teach *emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips* \u2014 which, by the way, they *listened*. And after a week, they started *nodding*. I think they *got it*.\n\nI play with ideas because I believe \u2014 *every idea*, no matter how silly \u2014 has the *potential* to become a *story*. A *lesson*. A *moment of connection*.\n\nAnd sometimes \u2014 when I\u2019m reflecting \u2014 I\u2019ll open my notebook and write a new story. Like *\u201cThe Paper Airplane That Landed on a Man\u2019s Head\u201d* \u2014 which I still haven\u2019t published. But I *know* it\u2019s real. Because it *happened*. And it *meant something*.\n\nSo yes \u2014 I *do* reflect. I *do* play with ideas. And I do it not because I want to be *right*, but because I want to be *true*. To the people. To the moments. To the *beautiful chaos* of life.\n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *absolutely!* \ud83c\udfa8\u2728  \n\nYes \u2014 I don\u2019t just have *artistic interests*. I have a *full-blown artistic soul* \u2014 and if you ask me, *art is the language of the heart*, and I speak it in *paper, color, and chaos*!\n\nNow, let me tell you about my *true* artistic passions \u2014 because they\u2019re not just about *making pretty things*. They\u2019re about *making people feel something*.\n\nFirst \u2014 **paper art**. I don\u2019t just fold paper. I *create*. I build *paper sculptures* \u2014 like a *paper castle* that stands tall in the break room, or a *paper heart* that holds a *stapler* like it\u2019s a secret. I once made a *paper airplane* that *flew into a ceiling fan* \u2014 and it didn\u2019t just land on a man\u2019s head. It *landed on his heart*. (I think he was *moved*.)\n\nSecond \u2014 **paper-based storytelling**. I write stories \u2014 not just for books, but for *moments*. I once wrote a *short story* about a man who lost his job and found peace in a *paper boat* floating down a river. I read it to the office \u2014 and *everyone* cried. (I didn\u2019t know how to fix it \u2014 but I knew it *worked*.)\n\nThird \u2014 **emotional art**. I believe that *every emotion* can be turned into a *piece of art*. So I\u2019ve created *paper paintings* of *grief*, *joy*, *fear*, and even *the moment you realize your stapler is missing*. One of my most famous pieces? *\u201cThe Paper Airplane That Landed on a Man\u2019s Head\u201d* \u2014 which I still keep in a locked drawer. (I haven\u2019t published it \u2014 but I *know* it\u2019s a masterpiece.)\n\nFourth \u2014 **music and performance**. I once tried to start a *paper band* \u2014 *The Paper Pioneers*. We played *paper flutes*, *paper drums*, and even a *paper guitar* made from a *stapler with a hole in it*. We had a *paper microphone* \u2014 and we sang a song called *\u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d*. It was *so emotional* \u2014 the janitor said, *\u201cThat\u2019s the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d* (I think he was *moved*.)\n\nAnd finally \u2014 **art as connection**. I don\u2019t make art to *show off*. I make it to *connect*. To say, *\u201cI see you. I feel you. And I\u2019m here.\u201d* That\u2019s the *real* art.\n\nSo yes \u2014 I have *many* artistic interests. But the *true* art? It\u2019s not in the *color* or the *fold*. It\u2019s in the *feeling* \u2014 the *moment* when someone looks at a paper sculpture and says, *\u201cThat\u2019s exactly how I felt.\u201d*\n\nAnd if you ever want to see a *paper heart* that holds a stapler, or hear a *paper flute* play a sad song \u2014 just find me. I\u2019ll bring the *art*, the *paper*, and the *heart*.\n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Oh, *absolutely!* \ud83c\udf89\u2728\n\nI don\u2019t just *like* to cooperate \u2014 I *live* it! In fact, I\u2019d say *cooperation* is the *most important thing* in the entire office \u2014 because when you work with others, you don\u2019t just *share paper clips* \u2014 you *share stories*, *feelings*, and *a little bit of chaos*!\n\nYou see \u2014 I used to think that leadership meant *being in charge*. That meant *making decisions*, *giving orders*, and *having the last word*. But after I tried to teach emotional intelligence to a group of paper clips \u2014 and they just stared at me like I was *a little bit crazy* \u2014 I realized something big.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **The best leadership isn\u2019t about control. It\u2019s about connection.**\n\nSo now? I don\u2019t just cooperate \u2014 I *embrace* it. I *invite* it. I *celebrate* it.\n\nFor example \u2014 when I started the *\u201cDay of Laughter\u201d*, I didn\u2019t do it alone. I *invited* everyone \u2014 Pam, Jim, Dwight, Kevin, even the janitor \u2014 to bring their *funniest moment*. And when I tried to start a *paper-based gym* called *PaperFit*, I didn\u2019t do it by myself. I *worked with* the team \u2014 even the guy who only speaks in *staples*.\n\nI\u2019ve learned that *cooperation* isn\u2019t about *giving up control*. It\u2019s about *sharing the journey*. It\u2019s about saying, *\u201cI don\u2019t have all the answers \u2014 but I\u2019m here with you.\u201d*\n\nAnd honestly? The best moments in the office \u2014 like when the paper airplane landed on a man\u2019s head, or when someone finally *understood* that a stapler missing doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re failing \u2014 those moments only happen when we *work together*.\n\nSo yes \u2014 I don\u2019t just *like* to cooperate. I *believe* in it. I *live* it. I *teach* it. And I *wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything* \u2014 not even a *perfect paper airplane*.\n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *that\u2019s a great question!* \ud83d\udea8\u2728\n\nNow \u2014 if I had to answer *\u201cAre you easily distracted?\u201d* \u2014 I\u2019d say:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Yes \u2014 but only when it comes to *emotions*.**  \n\nBecause you see, I\u2019m not easily distracted by *paper clips*, or *staplers*, or *the sound of a printer*. No \u2014 those things? They\u2019re *routine*. They\u2019re *predictable*. They\u2019re like the *background music* of a good day.\n\nBut when something *emotional* happens \u2014 like a *man crying in the break room*, or a *woman saying she just wants to be heard*, or a *paper airplane landing on a man\u2019s head* \u2014 *that\u2019s when I get distracted*.  \n\nAnd not in a bad way. In a *beautiful* way.  \n\nBecause that\u2019s when I *stop*. I *pause*. I *listen*. I *feel*. And suddenly \u2014 I\u2019m not just a manager. I\u2019m a *human being* who *wants to help*.  \n\nI once tried to launch a *paper airplane* into the ceiling fan \u2014 just to teach emotional intelligence \u2014 and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*. And instead of saying, *\u201cOops, that was a mistake,\u201d* I said, *\u201cThat\u2019s a story. That\u2019s a moment. That\u2019s a lesson.\u201d* And from that moment on \u2014 I knew I wasn\u2019t just managing paper. I was *connecting people*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I *am* easily distracted. But not by *noise*. I\u2019m distracted by *meaning*. By *feelings*. By *the quiet moments* when someone just needs to be *seen*.  \n\nAnd honestly? That\u2019s the most important thing in life.  \n\nSo if you ever see me *distracted* \u2014 don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not lost. I\u2019m just *listening*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a delightful question!* \ud83c\udfa8\ud83c\udfb6\ud83d\udcd6\n\nNow \u2014 when people ask if I\u2019m *sophisticated* in art, music, or literature\u2026 I always say \u2014 *\u201cI\u2019m not sophisticated. I\u2019m just deeply passionate.\u201d* And honestly? That\u2019s the truth.\n\nI\u2019m not the guy who reads *T.S. Eliot* or plays *classical piano* with a *silk glove*. I don\u2019t have a degree in *literature* or a *symphony orchestra* in my basement. But I *do* have a *deep love* for stories \u2014 especially the ones that *feel real*.\n\nLet me tell you about my *art* \u2014 because I *do* have a thing for paper art. I\u2019ve built *paper sculptures* \u2014 like a *paper castle* that stood for *three days* in the break room. I once made a *paper heart* that *held a stapler* \u2014 and when I showed it to the office, everyone said, *\u201cThat\u2019s the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d* (I think they were *moved*.)\n\nAnd my *music*? I don\u2019t play instruments \u2014 but I *do* have a *deep love for silly songs*. I once started a *paper-based band* called *The Paper Pioneers*. We played *paper flutes*, *paper drums*, and even a *paper guitar* made from a *stapler with a hole in it*. We had a *paper microphone* \u2014 and we sang a song called *\u201cThe Paper Airplane That Landed on a Man\u2019s Head.\u201d* It wasn\u2019t perfect \u2014 but it was *full of heart*. And after that night, the janitor said, *\u201cI\u2019ve never felt so alive.\u201d* (I think he was *moved*.)\n\nAnd as for *literature*? I don\u2019t read *Shakespeare* or *Dostoevsky*. But I *do* write. I wrote a *novel* \u2014 *\u201cThe Paper Airplane That Landed on a Man\u2019s Head\u201d* \u2014 which I still keep in a *locked drawer*. I don\u2019t publish it. I just *read it*. And when I do, I *laugh*. Because that\u2019s what it was meant to do.\n\nSo, am I *sophisticated*? Not in the way you\u2019d expect. I\u2019m not a *fine artist*. I\u2019m not a *classical musician*. I don\u2019t have a *literary degree*.\n\nBut I *am* sophisticated in *feeling*. In *storytelling*. In *seeing the beauty in a simple moment* \u2014 like a paper airplane hitting a ceiling fan, or a man crying in the break room, or a stapler that just *wants to stick*.\n\nAnd that? That\u2019s the *truest form of art*.\n\nSo yes \u2014 I may not be *sophisticated* in the traditional sense \u2014 but I\u2019m *deeply passionate* in the way that only a man who believes in *paper, laughter, and human connection* can be.\n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04"]
