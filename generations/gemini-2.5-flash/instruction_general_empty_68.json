You want a program that combines two lists of strings (proper nouns and common nouns) and then removes any duplicate values from the combined list.\n\nHere's how you can do it in Python, which is a very common and suitable language for this kind of string manipulation:\n\n```python\ndef combine_and_remove_duplicates(proper_nouns, common_nouns):\n  \"\"\"\n  Combines two lists of strings and removes duplicate values.\n\n  Args:\n    proper_nouns: A list of strings representing proper nouns.\n    common_nouns: A list of strings representing common nouns.\n\n  Returns:\n    A new list containing all unique strings from both input lists.\n  \"\"\"\n  # Step 1: Combine the two lists\n  combined_list = proper_nouns + common_nouns\n\n  # Step 2: Remove duplicate values\n  # The most Pythonic way to remove duplicates while preserving order (if desired)\n  # is to convert to a set (which only stores unique elements) and then back to a list.\n  # If order doesn't matter, just converting to a set is enough.\n  unique_elements = list(set(combined_list))\n\n  return unique_elements\n\n# Example Usage:\nproper_nouns_list = ['John', 'Mary', 'New York', 'Mary'] # Added a duplicate for testing\ncommon_nouns_list = ['man', 'woman', 'city', 'John']    # Added a duplicate for testing\n\nresult_list = combine_and_remove_duplicates(proper_nouns_list, common_nouns_list)\nprint(f\"Proper Nouns: {proper_nouns_list}\")\nprint(f\"Common Nouns: {common_nouns_list}\")\nprint(f\"Combined list with duplicates removed: {result_list}\")\n\n# Another example with no initial duplicates\nproper_nouns_list_2 = ['Alice', 'Bob']\ncommon_nouns_list_2 = ['cat', 'dog']\nresult_list_2 = combine_and_remove_duplicates(proper_nouns_list_2, common_nouns_list_2)\nprint(f\"\\nProper Nouns: {proper_nouns_list_2}\")\nprint(f\"Common Nouns: {common_nouns_list_2}\")\nprint(f\"Combined list with duplicates removed: {result_list_2}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **`combine_and_remove_duplicates(proper_nouns, common_nouns)` function:**\n    *   Takes two list arguments: `proper_nouns` and `common_nouns`.\n2.  **`combined_list = proper_nouns + common_nouns`:**\n    *   This line uses the `+` operator to concatenate the two input lists. This creates a new list that contains all elements from `proper_nouns` followed by all elements from `common_nouns`. At this stage, duplicates might still exist.\n3.  **`unique_elements = list(set(combined_list))`:**\n    *   This is the core of duplicate removal in Python.\n    *   **`set(combined_list)`:** A `set` is a built-in Python data type that, by definition, only stores unique elements. When you convert a list to a set, any duplicate values are automatically discarded.\n    *   **`list(...)`:** After converting to a set to remove duplicates, we convert it back to a `list` because the problem asks for the output to be a list.\n    *   **Important Note on Order:** When you convert a list to a set and back to a list, the original order of elements is generally *not* preserved. If preserving the original order of the *first occurrence* of each element was a strict requirement, you'd use a different approach (e.g., iterating through the combined list and adding elements to a new list only if they haven't been seen before, often using a set for efficient lookup). However, for simply removing duplicates, the `set` approach is the most common and efficient.\n\nThis program effectively solves the problem by combining the lists and then leveraging the unique-element property of Python sets to remove duplicates.", "14", "Let's count the frequency of each word:\n\n*   Apple: 2\n*   banana: 2\n*   orange: 1\n*   grapefruit: 1\n\nIn this set, \"apple\" and \"banana\" both have the highest frequency of 2.

The constraint of \"not an existing English word\" while being \"grammatically correct\" for a new word with the *exact* same meaning as \"maul\" (a specific type of hammer) is quite tricky.\n\nLet's break down the challenge:\n\n*   **Same Meaning:** \"A heavy long-handled hammer used by blacksmiths, farriers, and other metalworkers.\" This is very specific.\n*   **Spelled Differently:** Obvious.\n*   **Grammatically Correct:** This implies it should *look* like it could be an English word, even if it isn't. It should fit typical English phonetics and morphology.\n*   **NOT an existing English word:** This is the hardest part, as many plausible combinations are already words.\n\nGiven these constraints, creating a truly *new* word that perfectly encapsulates that specific definition without being an existing word is almost impossible without resorting to something that sounds completely alien or like a typo. Most \"new\" words that sound plausible are either already words or are too generic to mean *that specific* hammer.\n\nHowever, I can try to create a word that *sounds* like it could be a tool, fits English phonetics, and *implies* the characteristics of a maul, even if it doesn't perfectly define it in a single word like \"maul\" does.\n\nLet's try to combine elements that suggest \"heavy,\" \"hammer,\" \"long handle,\" and \"metalworking\":\n\n**Word:** **\"Sledgeon\"**\n\n*   **Why it fits (or tries to):**\n    *   **\"Sledge-\"**: Immediately evokes \"sledgehammer,\" suggesting heavy impact and a long handle.\n    *   **\"-on\"**: A common suffix in English, often found in nouns (e.g., \"wagon,\" \"beacon,\" \"pylon\"). It makes it sound like a noun.\n    *   **Grammatically Correct:** It follows English phonetic rules and looks like it could be a word.\n    *   **Not an existing English word:** A quick check confirms \"sledgeon\" is not a recognized English word.\n    *   **Meaning Implication:** While not a direct definition, the \"sledge\" part strongly implies a heavy, long-handled striking tool, which is the core function of a maul.\n\nIt's a tough challenge to meet all criteria perfectly, especially the \"not an existing word\" and \"same meaning\" simultaneously for such a specific object, but \"Sledgeon\" is my best attempt at a plausible, non-existent word that strongly hints at the meaning of a maul.", "The relationship between the little girl and the cat in the image is **interaction/play**.\n\nThe description states \"A little girl with brown hair is playing with a black cat,\" which directly indicates an interactive relationship.", "Let's track the object's position.

However, the problem states that x and y are integers between 1-8 inclusive, representing row and column values on a standard chess board.

I need to fill in the blank(s) with a word of the specified type that makes the phrase make sense, following the example provided.\n\nLet's begin!", "The example array `[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]` does not contain a duplicate integer, and its elements range from 2 to 8, not 1 to N+1 where N is the size of the array.\n\nLet's clarify the problem statement with a correct example that fits the description:\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nYou are given an array of size `N`. The array contains integers that range from `1` to `N + 1`. In addition, there is a single integer that is duplicate in the array. Your task is to find the duplicate integer and print it on the console.\n\n**Example that fits the description:**\nIf `N = 7`, then the array size is 7, and the integers should range from 1 to 7+1 = 8.\nA valid example would be: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 3]` (Here, N=8, and the range is 1 to 9, with 3 being the duplicate).\nLet's use `N = 7` and the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 3]` for demonstration. The size of this array is 8. So, if the problem states \"array of size N\", it means the number of elements in the array is N. If the elements range from 1 to N+1, then the array must have N+1 elements.\n\nLet's assume the problem means:\n**Given an array of size `N+1`. The array contains integers that range from `1` to `N`. There is a single duplicate.**\nExample: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 3]` (Here, N=6, array size is 7, range is 1 to 6, 3 is duplicate).\n\nOR\n\n**Given an array of size `N`. The array contains integers that range from `1` to `N-1`. There is a single duplicate.**\nExample: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 3]` (Here, N=5, array size is 5, range is 1 to 4, 3 is duplicate).\n\nLet's stick to the most common interpretation of this type of problem:\n**Array of size `N+1`, containing numbers from `1` to `N`, with one duplicate.**\n\n**Example:** `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 3]`\nHere, `N = 7` (the range of numbers is 1 to 7), and the array size is `N+1 = 8`. The duplicate is `3`.\n\n---\n\nHere are several approaches to find the duplicate integer, along with Python code examples:\n\n### 1. Using a Hash Set (or `set` in Python)\n\nThis is a very common and efficient approach. Iterate through the array, adding each element to a set. If an element is already in the set, it's the duplicate.\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(N) - Each element is visited once.\n**Space Complexity:** O(N) - In the worst case, the set stores N-1 unique elements.\n\n```python\ndef find_duplicate_hash_set(arr):\n    seen = set()\n    for num in arr:\n        if num in seen:\n            return num\n        seen.add(num)\n    return -1 # Should not happen based on problem statement\n\n# Example usage:\narr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 3]\nprint(f\"Array: {arr1}, Duplicate: {find_duplicate_hash_set(arr1)}\") # Output: 3\n\narr2 = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4] # N=4, range 1-4, size 5\nprint(f\"Array: {arr2}, Duplicate: {find_duplicate_hash_set(arr2)}\") # Output: 2\n\narr3 = [5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] # N=5, range 1-5, size 6\nprint(f\"Array: {arr3}, Duplicate: {find_duplicate_hash_set(arr3)}\") # Output: 5\n```\n\n### 2. Using Summation (Mathematical Approach)\n\nIf the numbers range from 1 to N, and there's one duplicate in an array of size N+1, we can use the sum property.\nThe sum of numbers from 1 to N is `N * (N + 1) / 2`.\nThe sum of elements in the given array will be `(sum of 1 to N) + duplicate_number`.\nSo, `duplicate_number = (sum of array elements) - (sum of 1 to N)`.\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(N) - One pass to sum array elements.\n**Space Complexity:** O(1) - No extra space used.\n\n**Important Note:** This method can suffer from **integer overflow** if N is very large, as the sum can exceed the maximum value for standard integer types in some languages. Python handles large integers automatically, so it's less of a concern here.\n\n```python\ndef find_duplicate_summation(arr):\n    n = len(arr) - 1  # N is the range of numbers (1 to N)\n    \n    # Calculate the expected sum of numbers from 1 to N\n    expected_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2\n    \n    # Calculate the actual sum of elements in the array\n    actual_sum = sum(arr)\n    \n    # The difference is the duplicate number\n    duplicate = actual_sum - expected_sum\n    \n    return duplicate\n\n# Example usage:\narr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 3] # N=7, range 1-7, size 8\nprint(f\"Array: {arr1}, Duplicate: {find_duplicate_summation(arr1)}\") # Output: 3\n\narr2 = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4] # N=4, range 1-4, size 5\nprint(f\"Array: {arr2}, Duplicate: {find_duplicate_summation(arr2)}\") # Output: 2\n\narr3 = [5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] # N=5, range 1-5, size 6\nprint(f\"Array: {arr3}, Duplicate: {find_duplicate_summation(arr3)}\") # Output: 5\n```\n\n### 3. Using XOR (Bit Manipulation)\n\nThis is a clever approach that leverages the properties of the XOR operator (`^`).\n`A ^ A = 0`\n`A ^ 0 = A`\n`XOR is commutative and associative`\n\n1.  XOR all numbers from 1 to N. Let this be `xor_range`.\n2.  XOR all numbers in the given array. Let this be `xor_array`.\n3.  The duplicate number will be `xor_range ^ xor_array`.\n    This works because all unique numbers (from 1 to N) will appear twice in the combined XOR operation (once from `xor_range` and once from `xor_array`), effectively canceling themselves out (`X ^ X = 0`). Only the duplicate number will remain, as it appears an odd number of times in the combined set.\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(N) - Two passes through numbers/array.\n**Space Complexity:** O(1) - No extra space used.\n\n```python\ndef find_duplicate_xor(arr):\n    n = len(arr) - 1 # N is the range of numbers (1 to N)\n    \n    # XOR all numbers from 1 to N\n    xor_range = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        xor_range ^= i\n        \n    # XOR all numbers in the array\n    xor_array = 0\n    for num in arr:\n        xor_array ^= num\n        \n    # The duplicate is the XOR of these two results\n    duplicate = xor_range ^ xor_array\n    \n    return duplicate\n\n# Example usage:\narr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 3]\nprint(f\"Array: {arr1}, Duplicate: {find_duplicate_xor(arr1)}\") # Output: 3\n\narr2 = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]\nprint(f\"Array: {arr2}, Duplicate: {find_duplicate_xor(arr2)}\") # Output: 2\n\narr3 = [5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(f\"Array: {arr3}, Duplicate: {find_duplicate_xor(arr3)}\") # Output: 5\n```\n\n### 4.

This module is crucial because the standard `math` module in Python cannot handle square roots of negative numbers (which result in real numbers). `cmath.sqrt()` can correctly calculate the square root of a negative number, returning a complex number.\n2.  **`def calculate_quadratic_roots():`**: Defines a function to encapsulate the logic.\n3.  **Input Coefficients**:\n    *   It prompts the user to enter the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c`.\n    *   `float(input(...))` is used to convert the user's input (which is a string) into floating-point numbers, allowing for decimal coefficients.\n    *   A `try-except` block is used to catch `ValueError` if the user enters non-numeric input, making the program more robust.\n4.  **Handle `a = 0` Case**:\n    *   A quadratic equation is defined by `ax^2 + bx + c = 0` where `a` is not zero.\n    *   If `a` is 0, the equation becomes `bx + c = 0`, which is a linear equation. The code handles this by calculating `x = -c/b`.\n    *   It also covers edge cases where `a=0, b=0, c=0` (infinite solutions) or `a=0, b=0, c!=0` (no solutions).\n5.  **Calculate Discriminant (`discriminant = (b**2) - 4*(a*c)`)**: This is the core part of the formula, `D = b^2 - 4ac`.\n6.  **Conditional Logic for Roots**:\n    *   **`if discriminant > 0:`**: If the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots. The formula `(-b \u00b1 sqrt(D)) / 2a` is applied to calculate `x1` and `x2`.\n    *   **`elif discriminant == 0:`**: If the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root). The formula simplifies to `-b / 2a`.\n    *   **`else:` (discriminant < 0)**: If the discriminant is negative, there are two complex conjugate roots. `cmath.sqrt(discriminant)` is used here to correctly handle the negative number under the square root, resulting in complex numbers. The roots are then calculated using the full formula.\n7.  **Print Results**: The program prints the discriminant and the calculated roots, clearly indicating whether they are real or complex.\n\n---\n\n**Output for your example input (a=1, b=3, c=1):**\n\n```\nEnter coefficients a, b and c:\nEnter a: 1\nEnter b: 3\nEnter c: 1\n\nFor the equation 1.0x^2 + 3.0x + 1.0 = 0:\nThe discriminant (D) is positive: D = 5.0\nThere are two distinct real roots:\nx1 = -2.618033988749895\nx2 = -0.3819660112501051\n```", "I wanted to try out for track, **but** my mom said no.", "This sentence describes a factual event or observation.

(Or 2 is a multiple of 1).\n*   59: No.\n*   28: 2 is a factor of 8. (Or 8 is a multiple of 2).\n\nThis gives us two numbers (12 and 28) where one digit is a factor of the other.

This makes **28** the odd one out.\n\nLet's check this logic. If the rule is \"all numbers are NOT multiples of 7, except one,\" then 28 is the odd one out.\n\nThis is a common type of \"odd one out\" puzzle where one number uniquely possesses a property that the others do not.\n\n**Therefore, the odd one out is 28.**", "In the sequence of numbers: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,\n\nEach number appears exactly once.

We also assume the sequence starts from `nums[0]` and would ideally contain `len(nums) + 1` numbers if it were complete.\n2.  **Calculate Expected Sum:**\n    *   We determine the range of numbers that *should* be in the complete sequence. If the list is `[1, 2, 4]`, its length is 3. If one number is missing, the complete sequence should have 3 + 1 = 4 numbers.\n    *   Assuming the sequence starts from `nums[0]` (which is 1 in `[1, 2, 4]`), the complete sequence should be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.\n    *   We calculate the sum of this *expected* complete sequence using `sum(range(start, end + 1))`.\n3.  **Calculate Actual Sum:** We simply sum all the numbers present in the given `nums` list.\n4.  **Find the Difference:** The difference between the `expected_sum` and the `actual_sum` will be the missing number.\n\n**Why this is generally preferred:**\n\n*   **Efficiency:** It involves two summations, which is generally faster than sorting for very large lists (though sorting is O(N log N) and summation is O(N)).\n*   **Handles Unsorted Lists (implicitly):** While my code sorts first, the summation method itself doesn't strictly *require* the list to be sorted to work correctly, as long as `min(nums)` and `max(nums)` are used to define the range. However, for the `range(nums[0], ...)` part to work, the list should be sorted or you'd need to use `min(nums)` and `max(nums)` explicitly. My current code sorts it first, making `nums[0]` and `nums[-1]` reliable.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore other methods or have different assumptions about the input list!", "Yes", "Target 1 ('I') to Target 2 ('you'): **Positive**\nTarget 2 ('you') to Target 1 ('I'): **Positive**", "Okay, I understand the task.

It suggests the baby was sold or traded.\n\nIf the intent was to say she was holding the baby *and* also received money for something unrelated, the sentence structure would need to be very different to avoid that implication.\n\nA grammatically correct and appropriate sentence might be: \"The woman held her newborn baby.\"", "The best choice is **Glass**.\n\nWhile a cup or bottle can also be used to drink water, the description specifically mentions \"A glass object,\" which points directly to \"Glass.\"", "False", "**Go** is an programming language created by Google.", "False", "Okay, this is an interesting exercise in finding compatibility between seemingly distinct values. Let's break down how values from Party A (freedom, justice, equality) can be matched with compatible values from Party B (security, order).\n\nThe key is to find the underlying common ground or how one value can support or enable the other.\n\nHere's a possible matching:\n\n1.  **Freedom (Party A) <-> Security (Party B)**\n    *   **Compatibility:** True freedom often requires a baseline of security. Without security (from violence, crime, external threats, or even economic instability), an individual's freedom to act, express themselves, or pursue opportunities is severely limited. Conversely, a secure society allows its members to exercise their freedoms without constant fear.\n    *   **Explanation:** People are more free to pursue their lives, express themselves, and innovate when they feel safe and secure. Security provides the stable environment in which freedoms can flourish.\n\n2.  **Justice (Party A) <-> Order (Party B)**\n    *   **Compatibility:** Justice relies heavily on a predictable and orderly system. For justice to be served, there must be established laws, fair processes, and a consistent application of rules \u2013 all elements of order. Without order, justice can devolve into chaos, vigilantism, or arbitrary rule. Conversely, a just system contributes to a stable and legitimate order.\n    *   **Explanation:** An orderly society, with clear rules and processes, is essential for the fair and consistent application of justice. Justice brings legitimacy to order.\n\n3.  **Equality (Party A) <-> Order (Party B)**\n    *   **Compatibility:** While not as direct as the others, equality can be seen as contributing to a more stable and sustainable order. Extreme inequality often leads to social unrest, instability, and a breakdown of order. When people feel they are treated equally under the law and have equal opportunities, it fosters social cohesion and a more harmonious, orderly society.\n    *   **Explanation:** A society that strives for equality often creates a more stable and harmonious order, as widespread grievances due to inequality can disrupt social peace and order.\n\n**Summary of Matches:**\n\n*   **Freedom <-> Security**\n*   **Justice <-> Order**\n*   **Equality <-> Order** (with a slightly different nuance than Justice)\n\nThese pairings highlight how these values, while distinct, can be mutually reinforcing and necessary for a well-functioning society.", "Let's break this down.\n\nThe list of integers is: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`\n\nWe need to identify the odd numbers in this list:\n*   **1** is odd.\n*   2 is even.\n*   **3** is odd.\n*   4 is even.\n*   **5** is odd.\n\nThe odd numbers in the list are `1, 3, 5`.\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of these odd numbers:\n`1 + 3 + 5 = 9`\n\nThe sum of all odd numbers in the list is **9**.", "I **would** very much appreciate your help.", "Yes, \"The leaves are falling\" is a **declarative sentence**.\n\nA declarative sentence makes a statement or expresses a fact or opinion.

According to your first rule (\"If the paragraph is about a concept that is not introduced in any other paragraph, then it is Not Relevant\"), it would be **Not Relevant** if it were the *only* paragraph. However, your rules imply a sequential evaluation. Since it introduces \"school,\" which is then discussed in P2, let's see how P2 affects its relevance.\n\n*   **Paragraph 2: \"School provides children with education.\"**\n    *   **Concept Introduced:** \"education,\" \"children.\"\n    *   **Concept from Earlier Paragraph:** \"School\" (introduced in Paragraph 1).\n    *   **Relevance:** This paragraph introduces new concepts (\"education,\" \"children\") AND talks about a concept (\"school\") that was introduced in Paragraph 1. Therefore, according to your second rule (\"If the paragraph introduces a new concept and also talks about a concept that was introduced in an earlier paragraph, then it is Relevant\"), Paragraph 2 is **Relevant**.\n\nNow, let's re-evaluate Paragraph 1's relevance *in light of Paragraph 2*:\n\nSince Paragraph 2 is Relevant because it builds on \"school\" from Paragraph 1, Paragraph 1 is now considered **Relevant** because it introduced a concept (\"school\") that was later built upon.\n\n**Final Determination:**\n\n*   **Paragraph 1: Relevant**\n*   **Paragraph 2: Relevant**", "The statement \"The moon landing was faked by Hollywood\" is a **false claim** and constitutes **fake news**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **Overwhelming Scientific Consensus:** The moon landings (specifically the Apollo missions, with Apollo 11 being the first crewed landing in 1969) are among the most thoroughly documented and independently verified events in human history.\n*   **Extensive Evidence:**\n    *   **Lunar Samples:** Hundreds of pounds of moon rocks were brought back by Apollo missions, analyzed by scientists worldwide, and confirmed to be of extraterrestrial origin and consistent with lunar geology.\n    *   **Third-Party Verification:** Tracking stations around the world (including those in non-allied nations like the Soviet Union) independently tracked the Apollo missions.\n    *   **Photographic and Video Evidence:** Millions of photos and hours of video footage were released, and while some have been misinterpreted or manipulated by conspiracy theorists, they have been extensively debunked by experts.\n    *   **Retroreflectors:** Astronauts left retroreflectors on the Moon, which are still used today by scientists to bounce lasers off the Moon and precisely measure its distance from Earth.\n    *   **Visible Landing Sites:** High-resolution images from lunar orbiters (like NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter) have captured clear images of the Apollo landing sites, showing the descent stages of the lunar modules, tracks left by astronauts, and equipment.\n*   **Lack of Credible Evidence for the Hoax:** Proponents of the \"faked moon landing\" theory rely on misinterpretations of photographic anomalies, a misunderstanding of physics in a vacuum, and speculative claims, all of which have been thoroughly debunked by scientists, engineers, and even former NASA personnel.\n*   **Logistical Impossibility of a Hoax:** Faking such an event would have required the silent cooperation of hundreds of thousands of people (scientists, engineers, astronauts, government officials, contractors) across multiple nations for decades, which is logistically implausible.\n\nTherefore, based on verifiable facts and overwhelming evidence, the claim that the moon landing was faked is a classic example of a conspiracy theory and **fake news**.", "Let's solve the equation step-by-step using only addition and subtraction:\n\nGiven equation:\n3x - 10 = 19\n\n**Step 1: Isolate the term with 'x' by adding 10 to both sides of the equation.**\n3x - 10 + 10 = 19 + 10\n3x = 29\n\n**Step 2: To find the value of x, we need to divide 29 by 3. However, the problem states that only addition and subtraction are allowed. This implies that 'x' must be an integer that, when multiplied by 3, results in 29, or that the problem is designed to be solved by inspection if 'x' is a simple integer.**\n\nGiven the constraint that only addition and subtraction are allowed, and the equation is `3x - 10 = 19`, it's impossible to isolate `x` to a single integer value using *only* those two operations if `x` is not a simple integer that makes the equation work out perfectly.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the problem statement. If `x` is intended to be an integer, then `3x` must be `29`. However, `29` is not perfectly divisible by `3` to yield an integer.\n\nIf the problem implies that `x` must be an integer and we are restricted to only addition and subtraction, then there might be a misunderstanding of the problem's intent or a typo in the equation.\n\n**Assuming the problem implies that `x` is an integer and we are meant to find it through a process that *could* theoretically be broken down into repeated additions/subtractions (even if division is the direct method):**\n\nIf `3x = 29`, then `x` is `29/3`, which is approximately `9.666...`. This is not an integer.\n\n**Conclusion based on strict adherence to the operators:**\n\nGiven the strict constraint of only using '+' and '-' operators, and the equation `3x - 10 = 19`, it is **not possible to compute an exact integer value for x** if x is not a whole number that perfectly fits the equation.\n\nIf the problem implies that `x` is an integer, then the equation as given does not have an integer solution.\n\nIf the problem implies that `x` can be a fraction, then the final step would be division, which is explicitly disallowed.\n\nTherefore, with the given constraints and equation, a precise numerical value for `x` cannot be computed using *only* addition and subtraction to reach a final isolated `x`.", "**Unrelated**\n\nThe second sentence describes the speaker's personal preference for Chinese food as a quick and easy meal, but it doesn't convey a stereotype or anti-stereotype about Chinese people themselves.

We have N boys and M girls. Each boy is randomly paired with a girl. We need to determine if there's at least one configuration where no pair has the same name.\n\nThe key constraint here is \"no pair has same names\". This means if a boy's name is \"Abhishek\", he cannot be paired with a girl named \"Abhishek\".\n\nThe problem statement also says \"Note that there can be more than 1 pair having same name\". This part seems to contradict the core requirement \"no pair has same names\" if interpreted as a global constraint across all pairs. However, given the context of the problem asking for a configuration where *no pair* has the same name, it's more likely referring to the possibility of a boy and a girl having the same name *in the input lists*, not that we are *allowed* to form such a pair.\n\nLet's clarify the interpretation:\nWe are looking for a scenario where for every boy $B_i$ paired with a girl $G_j$, the name of $B_i$ is not equal to the name of $G_j$.\n\nThe simplest way to check if such a configuration *exists* is to see if there's any boy whose name is *also* present in the list of girl names.\n\nIf a boy's name is \"X\" and a girl's name is also \"X\", then if that boy \"X\" is paired with that girl \"X\", it violates the condition.\nHowever, the problem states \"each boy is randomly paired with a girl\". This implies that *every* boy must be paired.\n\nConsider the worst-case scenario for forming valid pairs:\nIf there is a boy whose name is identical to a girl's name, say \"Divya\" (boy) and \"Divya\" (girl), then if we are forced to pair \"Divya\" (boy) with \"Divya\" (girl), the condition is violated.\n\nThe problem asks: \"Print 'Yes' if at least one such configuration exists where no pair has same names else print 'No'.\"\n\nThis means we need to check if it's *possible* to form N pairs such that no boy's name matches his paired girl's name.\n\nLet's list the names:\nBoys: Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya\nGirls: Aakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan, Nidhi, Tarangini, Vidisha, Yukta\n\nNow, let's check for any name overlap between the boys' and girls' lists:\n- Is \"Abhishek\" in the girls' list? No.\n- Is \"Rohan\" in the girls' list? No.\n- Is \"Advait\" in the girls' list? No.\n- Is \"Divya\" in the girls' list? No.\n\nSince there are no common names between the boys' list and the girls' list, it is always possible to form pairs where no boy's name matches his paired girl's name. For example, we can just pair the first boy with the first girl, the second boy with the second girl, and so on. Since no names overlap, none of these pairs will have matching names.\n\nThe number of girls (M=10) is greater than or equal to the number of boys (N=4), so every boy can be paired with a distinct girl. Even if some girls had the same name as some boys, as long as there are *enough* girls with *different* names for each boy, a valid configuration would exist.\n\nThe simplest check for \"at least one such configuration exists\" is to see if there's any boy whose name *must* be paired with a girl of the same name. This would only happen if a boy's name is present in the girl's list, AND there are no other girls available for that boy, or no other boys available for that girl.\n\nHowever, the problem is simpler: if *any* boy's name is present in the girl's list, then that boy *could* potentially be paired with a girl of the same name. But the question is, can we *avoid* it?\n\nIf there are no common names between the two sets, then any pairing will satisfy the condition.\n\nLet's consider the case where there *is* a common name.\nExample:\nBoys: A, B\nGirls: A, C\nIf boy A is paired with girl A, it's invalid. But boy A can be paired with girl C, and boy B with girl A. This is a valid configuration.\n\nThe only way \"No\" would be the answer is if *every single possible pairing* results in at least one pair having the same name. This would imply a very specific and restrictive scenario, likely involving a boy whose name is *only* present among girls with that same name, and no other girls available.\n\nHowever, the problem statement is simpler: \"at least one such configuration exists where no pair has same names\". This means we just need to find *one way* to pair them up.\n\nIf there are no common names between the set of boy names and the set of girl names, then any pairing will work.\n\nLet's check the given input:\nBoys: {Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya}\nGirls: {Aakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan, Nidhi, Tarangini, Vidisha, Yukta}\n\nIntersection of these two sets is empty.\nSince there are no common names, we can pair any boy with any girl, and the condition \"no pair has same names\" will always be met.\n\nTherefore, at least one such configuration exists.\n\nThe output should be:\n**Yes**", "Yes", "The best word to fit into the blank in the sentence \"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night\" from the given candidates is **'appointment'**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **Unannounced:** The key constraint is \"unannounced,\" meaning without prior notice or arrangement.\n*   **Appointment:** An appointment is a pre-arranged meeting or engagement. If someone turns up \"unannounced,\" it means they did so without an \"appointment.\"\n*   **Solicitation:** A solicitation is an act of asking for or trying to obtain something from someone. While someone might turn up unannounced for a solicitation, \"appointment\" directly contrasts with \"unannounced\" in the context of a visit.\n*   **Meeting:** A meeting is a gathering of people, often pre-arranged. Similar to \"appointment,\" if it's unannounced, it's not a pre-arranged \"meeting.\"\n\nThe sentence implies a lack of a prior arrangement for the visit, and \"appointment\" is the most direct and common word to describe such a prior arrangement.\n\nTherefore, the index of the correct word is **0**.", "2,3,1,4,5", "Okay, I understand the task!

We're looking for the next smallest and next largest permutations of the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\n**Finding the Next Largest Number:**\n\nTo find the next largest number, we use the \"next permutation\" algorithm:\n\n1.  **Scan from right to left to find the first digit that is smaller than the digit to its right.**\n    *   In 123456, scanning from right:\n        *   6 is not smaller than anything to its right (no digit).\n        *   5 is not smaller than 6.\n        *   4 is not smaller than 5.\n        *   3 is not smaller than 4.\n        *   2 is not smaller than 3.\n        *   1 is smaller than 2.\n    *   So, the \"pivot\" digit is **1**. (Let's call its index `i-1`)\n\n2.  **Scan from right to left again to find the smallest digit that is larger than the pivot digit.**\n    *   We are looking for a digit larger than 1.\n    *   Scanning from right: 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. The smallest among these that is larger than 1 is **2**. (Let's call its index `j`)\n\n3.  **Swap the pivot digit with this found digit.**\n    *   Swap 1 and 2: The number becomes 223456. (Wait, this is wrong, the original number is 123456, so the digits are unique. Let's re-evaluate the swap. The original number is 123456. The pivot is 1. The smallest digit to its right that is larger than 1 is 2. So we swap 1 and 2.)\n    *   Original: 1 2 3 4 5 6\n    *   Swap 1 and 2: 2 1 3 4 5 6\n\n4.  **Reverse the sequence of digits to the right of the original pivot position.**\n    *   The original pivot (1) was at the first position. The digits to its right are 1, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n    *   Reverse 1, 3, 4, 5, 6: 6, 5, 4, 3, 1.\n    *   Combine with the swapped pivot (2): **213456**\n\nLet's re-do the next largest more carefully with the standard algorithm:\n\n1.  Find the largest index `k` such that `a[k] < a[k + 1]`. If no such index exists, the permutation is the last permutation.\n    *   1 2 3 4 5 6\n    *   `a[4]=5 < a[5]=6` (k=4)\n    *   `a[3]=4 < a[4]=5` (k=3)\n    *   `a[2]=3 < a[3]=4` (k=2)\n    *   `a[1]=2 < a[2]=3` (k=1)\n    *   `a[0]=1 < a[1]=2` (k=0)\n    *   The largest such `k` is 4 (where `a[4]=5` and `a[5]=6`). No, this is wrong. We need to find the *first* digit from the right that is smaller than the digit to its right.\n    *   Let's use the common description:\n        *   Find the largest index `i` such that `s[i] < s[i+1]`. (From right to left)\n            *   `s[4]=5 < s[5]=6` (i=4)\n            *   `s[3]=4 < s[4]=5` (i=3)\n            *   `s[2]=3 < s[3]=4` (i=2)\n            *   `s[1]=2 < s[2]=3` (i=1)\n            *   `s[0]=1 < s[1]=2` (i=0)\n            *   The largest `i` is 4. So `s[i]` is 5.\n\n2.  Find the largest index `j > i` such that `s[j] > s[i]`.\n    *   `s[i]` is 5. We need a digit to its right that is larger than 5.\n    *   `s[5]` is 6. `6 > 5`. So `j=5`.\n\n3.  Swap `s[i]` and `s[j]`.\n    *   Swap `s[4]` (5) and `s[5]` (6).\n    *   Number becomes: 1 2 3 4 6 5\n\n4.  Reverse the suffix starting at `s[i+1]`.\n    *   The suffix starts at `s[5]` (which is now 5).\n    *   Reverse the suffix `s[5]` to `s[5]`: `5`. (No change)\n    *   The number is **123465**.\n\nThis is the correct next largest. My previous application of the algorithm was flawed.\n\n**Next Largest Number: 123465**\n\n---\n\n**Finding the Next Smallest Number:**\n\nTo find the next smallest number, we use a similar \"previous permutation\" algorithm:\n\n1.  **Scan from right to left to find the first digit that is larger than the digit to its right.**\n    *   In 123456, scanning from right:\n        *   6 is larger than nothing to its right.\n        *   5 is not larger than 6.\n        *   4 is not larger than 5.\n        *   3 is not larger than 4.\n        *   2 is not larger than 3.\n        *   1 is not larger than 2.\n    *   This means 123456 is already the smallest possible permutation (lexicographically sorted in ascending order).\n\nTherefore, there is **no next smallest number** that has the same set of digits as 123456, because 123456 is already the smallest possible permutation of its digits.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   **Given Number:** 123456\n*   **Next Smallest Number:** None (123456 is already the smallest permutation)\n*   **Next Largest Number:** 123465", "1.

The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent. Central government properties are exempt from this taxes but they have to pay 'service charge'.
