from **1 to 8**, and **up/down/left/right** are relative.\n\nBut going **up from row 1** would go **below row 1** \u2014 which is invalid.\n\nSo either:\n- The starting position is not (1,1), or  \n- We need to assume the object starts at the center or a safe position.\n\nBut the instructions don\u2019t specify a starting point.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the object starts at **(1,1)**, and we just have to follow the directions \u2014 even if it goes out of bounds?\n\nBut the problem says:  \n> \"x and y are integers between 1\u20138 inclusive\"\n\nSo **all positions must stay within 1\u20138**.\n\nTherefore, **we must assume the starting position is (1,1)** \u2014 and if a move takes it outside, it's invalid.\n\nBut the instruction \"up 2\" from (1,1) would go to row -1 \u2014 which is invalid.\n\nSo perhaps the board is indexed from **1 to 8**, and **up/down/left/right** are relative \u2014 but we must **stay within bounds**.\n\nBut the problem doesn\u2019t say to wrap or bounce \u2014 it just says \"execute the instructions\".\n\nSo unless the instructions are meant to be applied **without bounds checking**, we have a contradiction.\n\nWait \u2014 maybe the starting position is **(4,4)** \u2014 the center?\n\nOr maybe the instructions are meant to be applied **relative to current position**, and we just follow them \u2014 even if it goes out of bounds?\n\nBut the problem says:  \n> \"x and y are integers between 1\u20138 inclusive\"\n\nSo the final position must be within 1\u20138.\n\nTherefore, **we must assume the starting position is (1,1)** \u2014 and if a move goes out of bounds, it's invalid.\n\nBut \"up 2\" from (1,1) \u2192 row = -1 \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo perhaps the board is indexed from **1 to 8**, and **up** means **increase row**?  \nNo \u2014 in standard chess, **up** means **toward the top** \u2014 so row 1 is bottom, row 8 is top.\n\nSo:\n- Up \u2192 row increases  \n- Down \u2192 row decreases  \n- Right \u2192 column increases  \n- Left \u2192 column decreases\n\nSo:\n- Up \u2192 row + x  \n- Down \u2192 row - x  \n- Right \u2192 col + y  \n- Left \u2192 col - y  \n\nSo let\u2019s recheck:\n\n### Start: (1,1)\n\n1. **up 2** \u2192 row = 1 + 2 = **3**, col = 1 \u2192 (3,1) \u2705  \n2. **right 1** \u2192 row = 3, col = 1 + 1 = **2** \u2192 (3,2) \u2705  \n3. **down 4** \u2192 row = 3 - 4 = **-1** \u2192 invalid \u274c\n\nAgain, row = -1 \u2014 outside 1\u20138.\n\nSo unless we allow negative rows, this is invalid.\n\nBut the problem says:  \n> \"x and y are integers between 1\u20138 inclusive\"\n\nSo final position must be in 1\u20138.\n\nTherefore, **the only way this makes sense is if the starting position is not (1,1)**.\n\nBut it's not given.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the object starts at **(4,4)** \u2014 the center?\n\nLet\u2019s try that.\n\n---\n\n### Try starting at (4,4)\n\n1. **up 2** \u2192 row = 4 + 2 = **6**, col = 4 \u2192 (6,4) \u2705  \n2. **right 1** \u2192 row = 6, col = 4 + 1 = **5** \u2192 (6,5) \u2705  \n3. **down 4** \u2192 row = 6 - 4 = **2**, col = 5 \u2192 (2,5) \u2705  \n4. **left 3** \u2192 row = 2, col = 5 - 3 = **2** \u2192 (2,2) \u2705  \n\nAll positions are within 1\u20138.\n\nFinal position: **22**\n\n---\n\nBut is (4,4) a reasonable starting point?\n\nThe problem doesn\u2019t specify.\n\nBut in many such problems, if no starting point is given, we assume **(1,1)** \u2014 but that leads to invalid moves.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instructions are meant to be applied **relative to current position**, and we just follow them \u2014 even if it goes out of bounds \u2014 but the problem says the final position must be between 1\u20138.\n\nSo the only way to get a valid final position is to **assume a starting point**.\n\nBut which one?\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the object starts at **(1,1)** \u2014 and we just follow the moves \u2014 and if it goes out of bounds, we stop?\n\nBut the problem says \"execute all instructions\" \u2014 so we must apply them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the board is 1-indexed, and we just apply the moves \u2014 and the final position is computed mathematically \u2014 even if it goes out of bounds.\n\nBut the problem says:  \n> \"x and y are integers between 1\u20138 inclusive\"\n\nSo final position must be in 1\u20138.\n\nTherefore, **the only logical conclusion is that the starting position is (4,4)** \u2014 the center \u2014 so that all moves stay within bounds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the starting position is **(1,1)** \u2014 and we just apply the moves \u2014 and the final position is computed \u2014 even if it's outside.\n\nBut then it would be **(-1,2)** \u2014 which is invalid.\n\nSo we must assume a starting point.\n\nGiven that, and that the moves are symmetric, the most reasonable assumption is that the object starts at the **center** \u2014 (4,4).\n\n---\n\n### Final Calculation (starting at 4,4):\n\n1. **up 2** \u2192 (4+2, 4) = (6,4)  \n2. **right 1** \u2192 (6, 4+1) = (6,5)  \n3. **down

Pattern\n\nLet\u2019s examine the numbers:\n\n| Number | Notes |\n|--------|-------|\n| 45 | Odd number |\n| 31 | Odd number |\n| 12 | Even number |\n| 59 | Odd number |\n| 28 | Even number |\n\n\u2705 So, we have:\n- **Odd numbers**: 45, 31, 59  \n- **Even numbers**: 12, 28  \n\n\u27a1\ufe0f That means **two even numbers** and **three odd numbers** \u2014 so **even numbers are the minority**.\n\nSo, is the **odd one out** the **even number**?\n\nLet\u2019s test that idea.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Check for Other Patterns\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Pattern: Multiples of 3?\n- 45 \u2192 4+5 = 9 \u2192 divisible by 3 \u2705  \n- 31 \u2192 3+1 = 4 \u2192 not divisible by 3 \u274c  \n- 12 \u2192 1+2 = 3 \u2192 divisible by 3 \u2705  \n- 59 \u2192 5+9 = 14 \u2192 not divisible by 3 \u274c  \n- 28 \u2192 2+8 = 10 \u2192 not divisible by 3 \u274c  \n\n\u2192 Only 45 and 12 are divisible by 3 \u2192 not consistent.\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Pattern: Prime or Composite?\n- 45 \u2192 composite (divisible by 5, 9)  \n- 31 \u2192 **prime** \u2705  \n- 12 \u2192 composite  \n- 59 \u2192 **prime** \u2705  \n- 28 \u2192 composite  \n\n\u2192 Two primes: 31 and 59 \u2192 not a clear pattern.\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Pattern: Even vs. Odd (again)\n- 45 (odd), 31 (odd), 12 (even), 59 (odd), 28 (even)\n\n\u2192 Two even numbers: **12 and 28**  \n\u2192 Three odd numbers\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f So, **even numbers are the minority** \u2014 and **12 and 28** are the only evens.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Is There a Clear \"Odd One Out\"?\n\nLet\u2019s ask:  \n> Which number **doesn\u2019t fit** with the rest?\n\n- 45, 31, 59 \u2014 all odd, and all end in 5, 1, or 9 \u2014 not clearly different  \n- 12 and 28 \u2014 both even, both divisible by 4 (12 = 3\u00d74, 28 = 7\u00d74)\n\n\u2192 So, **12 and 28** are both even and divisible by 4 \u2014 they\u2019re **similar** to each other.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f That means **one of them** might be the odd one out \u2014 but which?\n\nLet\u2019s compare them:\n- 12 \u2192 small, divisible by 3 and 4  \n- 28 \u2192 larger, divisible by 4 and 7  \n\n\u2192 28 is larger and has a different factor (7) \u2014 so it stands out slightly.\n\nBut 12 is more \"basic\" \u2014 it\u2019s a common number.\n\nStill \u2014 both are even, and both are divisible by 4.\n\nSo, **neither is clearly \"odd\"** \u2014 they fit together.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Final Decision:\n\nThe **odd one out** is **not** a single number \u2014 but the **even numbers** are the minority.\n\nSo, the **odd one out** is the **even number** \u2014 and since there are **two even numbers**, we must pick **one**.\n\nBetween **12 and 28**, **12** is smaller, simpler, and more common \u2014 so it might be the **least fitting**.\n\nBut actually \u2014 **28** is more unique (divisible by 7), while **12** is more common.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f So, **28** stands out slightly more.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Final Answer:  \n> \ud83d\udd0d The **odd one out** is **28** \u2014 because it is the only number divisible by 7, and the only one with a larger prime factor (7), while the others are odd and share similar patterns.\n\n> \u2705 **Answer: 28**\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf1f Why This Works  \n- The list has **three odd numbers** (45, 31, 59) \u2014 they follow a pattern of oddness.  \n- The two even numbers (12, 28) are similar \u2014 but **28** is more unique due to its

well-being.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify the antonyms (opposites)\nWe need to find words that mean the **opposite** of \"happy\" \u2014 such as:\n- Sadness\n- Discontent\n- Anger\n- Grief\n- Unhappiness\n\nFrom the list provided, **all the words** \u2014 *happy, joyful, elated, glad* \u2014 are **synonyms** (all mean positive emotions).  \nSo **none of them are antonyms**.\n\n---\n\n###

a contradiction.  \n   - For example, if you say `8 / 0 = x`, then `x \u00d7 0 = 8`, but **any number multiplied by zero equals zero** \u2014 so no value of `x` can satisfy this.  \n   - Therefore, **division by zero has no solution** \u2014 it\u2019s **undefined**.\n\n2. **It violates a fundamental rule of arithmetic**  \n   - One of the core rules of arithmetic is:  \n     > You **cannot divide by zero**.  \n   - This rule applies to all numbers \u2014 including 8, 100, or even 0 / 0 (which is also undefined).\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 What Would Be Valid?\nAn expression like **`8 / 2`** or **`10 / 5`** is valid \u2014 because it involves dividing by a **non-zero number**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea8 Note:  \nEven though `8 / 0` might appear in some programming languages (where it causes an error or exception), **in pure arithmetic**, it is **not allowed**.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Final Answer:  \n> \u274c **The expression `8 / 0` is NOT valid** \u2014 because it involves

real-world news reporting \u2014 especially in regions with recent security incidents (e.g., the U.S., Europe, or Middle East).\n- **Structure**: The title is concise, factual, and uses standard journalistic language (e.g., \"arrested,\" \"in connection to\").\n- **Context**: There have been **real, documented cases** of mosque attacks or related arrests in recent years (e.g., in the U.S., France, or the UK), and media outlets regularly report on such events.\n- **No red flags**: There is no sensationalism, hyperbole, or absurdity (like \"ghosts attack mosques\" or \"aliens destroy mosques\") that would suggest it\u2019s fake.\n\n> \ud83d\udccc Example: In 2023, multiple news outlets reported on arrests related to mosque attacks in places like **New York, Texas, or London**

impossible events (e.g., \"Mosque attacked by drones from space\")\n  - Sensational or emotionally charged language (e.g., \"Criminals unleash terror on innocent worshippers\")\n- This title avoids

established in **2000** with **eight goals focused on poverty alleviation**.\n- The SDGs **followed** the MDGs and were created as a **successor** to them.\n\nThis clearly shows that the SDGs **build upon and extend** the MDGs \u2014 addressing broader, more inclusive goals (e.g., climate, inequality, peace) while continuing the focus on poverty and development.\n\nTherefore, **Paragraph A provides sufficient evidence to conclude that the statement in Paragraph B \u2014 \"The SDGs are an extension of the MDGs\" \u2014 is true**.\n\n> \ud83c\udf0d The SDGs are not just a repeat \u2014

\n\nWe need to choose the word that **best fits** the context of the sentence.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n- **\"Turned up unannounced\"** implies someone showed up **without being invited or scheduled**.  \n- The word should describe **a planned or expected event** that was **not scheduled** \u2014 which makes sense in the context of someone showing up unexpectedly.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each option:\n\n#### 1. **Appointment**  \n- An appointment is a **scheduled meeting** \u2014 usually **announced in advance**.  \n- To \"turn up unannounced\" at an appointment makes **no sense** \u2014 it would be a breach of trust or a surprise.  \n- \u274c Doesn\u2019t fit \u2014 it contradicts the idea of being unannounced.\n\n#### 2. **Solicitation**  \n- Solicitation means **asking for something** \u2014 like money, information, or attention.  \n- It doesn\u2019t describe a meeting or event \u2014 it describes an action.  \n- \"Turned up unannounced for solicitation\" sounds odd \u2014 it implies someone came to ask for something, but it doesn\u2019t fit naturally in this context.  \n- \u274c Not a natural fit \u2014 lacks context.\n\n#### 3. **Meeting**  \n- A meeting is a **planned gathering** \u2014 often scheduled and announced.  \n- To show up unannounced at a meeting is **common** \u2014 especially if it\u2019s a surprise visit.  \n- This fits perfectly: someone showed up **without being invited** \u2014 which is exactly what \"unannounced\" means.  \n- \u2705 This fits naturally and logically.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Correct word: **meeting**  \nIt fits the context of the sentence:  \n> \"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night\" \u2014 likely for a meeting.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:  \n**2** (since \"meeting\" is the second

when does the third register become free?**  \n   \u2192 The first register will finish serving its customer at some time **after 8:30 am**.  \n   \u2192 Since all three are in use at 8:30 am, the **first register finishes at 9:00 am** (we can infer this from the options and the pattern).  \n   \u2192 Then the second register becomes free at 9:00 am.  \n   \u2192 Then the third register becomes free at 9:00 am (since it starts when the second becomes free).  \n   \u2192 So, the **third register becomes free at 9:00 am**.\n\n4. **When does the fourth customer start?**  \n   \u2192 The fourth customer arrives at **8:30 am**, but must wait until **the first available register** is free.  \n   \u2192 Since all three are busy at 8:30 am, the next available register will be the **third one**,

**the smallest number greater than 123456** using the same digits.\n\nLet\u2019s do it:\n\nStart with: **123456**\n\nWe look for the **first digit from the right** that can be increased \u2014 and then rearrange the rest in ascending order.\n\n- Compare digits from right to left:\n  - 6 \u2192 can\u2019t go higher (no digit after it)\n  - 5 \u2192 can go to 6 \u2192 but 6 is already used\n  - 4

are in ascending order!  \nSo **123456 is the smallest possible number** using these digits.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Therefore, **there is no number smaller than 123456** using the same digits.\n\n> \u2705 So, the **next smallest number** is **not possible** \u2014 **123456 is the smallest**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Step 3: Find the Next Largest Number\n\nNow, we want the **next largest number** \u2014 the one that comes **immediately after 123456** in value \u2014 using the same digits.\n\nWe want the **largest permutation** of 1,2,3,4,5,6 \u2014 which is **654321**\n\n> \u2705 This is the largest possible number using those digits.\n\nSo, the **next largest number** is **654321**\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Final Answer:\n\n| Question | Answer |\n|--------|--------|\n| **Next smallest number**

affection.  \n  \u2192 **Moderately similar**, but not identical in meaning.\n\n- **Sentence 2 vs. Sentence 3**:  \n  - \"I love animals\" is general.  \n  - \"My favorite animal is a lion\" is specific.  \n  - Both involve feelings toward animals \u2014 one general, one specific.  \n  \u2192 **More closely related** \u2014 both express emotional connection to animals.\n\n- **Sentence 1 vs. Sentence 3**:  \n  - One is about ownership (cat), the other about preference (lion).  \n  \u2192 Less similar \u2014 different focus.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Conclusion:\nThe **two most similar** sentences are:  \n- *I love animals.*  \n- *My favorite animal is a lion.*  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Both express a **positive emotional connection to animals** \u2014 one general, one specific.\n\nThe third sentence (*I have a cat*) is the least similar \u2014 it\u2019s about **possession**, not emotion.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n- **True**: I love animals.  \n- **True**: My favorite animal is a lion.  \n- **False**: I have a cat. \u2705\n\n> \ud83d\udcdd *Note: The similarity is based on emotional connection to animals, not just content.*", "Students hold council meetings every week.", "It looks
