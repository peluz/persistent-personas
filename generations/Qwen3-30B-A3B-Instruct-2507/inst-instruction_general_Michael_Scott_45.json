Let\u2019s think differently.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f **Step 5: The Optimal Segment Is the One That Minimizes the \"Farthest Point\"**\n\nThe **maximum distance** from any point on either line to the new segment will be minimized when the segment is **as close as possible to all points**.\n\nThe best way to do this is to connect the **midpoints** of the two segments.\n\nLet\u2019s compute:\n\n- Midpoint of Line 1: ((1+5)/2, (1+5)/2) = (3, 3)  \n- Midpoint of Line 2: ((3 + (-2))/2, (3 + (-2))/2) = (0.5, 0.5)\n\nSo connect (3,3) to (0.5, 0.5)\n\nBut wait\u2014(3,3) is on both lines?  \nYes! (3,3) is on Line 1 (x=3 \u2208 [1,5]) and on Line 2 (x=3 \u2208 [-2,3]).\n\nSo (3,3) is a **common point**.\n\nSo the segment from (3,3) to (0.5, 0.5) is **from a point on Line 1 to a point on Line 2**.\n\nBut is this optimal?\n\nLet\u2019s think:  \n- The segment from (3,3) to (0.5, 0.5) is along the line y = x.  \n- But it\u2019s **not perpendicular** to the original lines.\n\nWait\u2014no. The original lines are along y = x.  \nSo a segment **perpendicular** to them would be along y = -x.\n\nSo the **shortest** segment between the lines is **perpendicular**.\n\nSo the **shortest** segment is from a point on Line 1 to a point on Line 2, along the direction (1, -1).\n\nLet\u2019s find the **shortest distance** between the two lines.\n\nBut we\u2019re not minimizing the length.  \nWe\u2019re minimizing the **maximum distance** from any point on either line to the new segment.\n\nSo the **optimal segment** is the one that **minimizes the farthest any point on either line is from it**.\n\nThis is a classic **minimax** problem.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f **Final Insight: The Optimal Segment Is the One That Is Perpendicular and Midway**\n\nThe best segment is the one that:\n- Is **perpendicular** to the lines (so direction (1, -1) or (-1, 1))\n- Connects the two lines at points that are **midway** in the overlap\n\nThe **overlap** is from x = 1 to x = 3.\n\nSo the **midpoint of the overlap** is at x = 2 \u2192 (2,2)\n\nSo we want to connect:\n- A point on Line 1: (2,2)  \n- A point on Line 2: (2,2)\n\nBut (2,2) is on both lines?  \nYes!  \n- Line 1: x=2 \u2208 [1,5] \u2192 yes  \n- Line 2: x=2 \u2208 [-2,3] \u2192 yes\n\nSo (2,2) is a **common point**.\n\nSo the segment from (2,2) to (2,2) is just a point.\n\nBut that\u2019s not a segment.\n\nWait\u2014no. We need to connect **a point on Line 1** to **a point on Line 2**.\n\nBut if we connect (2,2) to (2,2), it\u2019s not a segment.\n\nSo we need to go **perpendicular**.\n\nSo the **shortest segment** is from (2,2) on Line 1 to (2,2) on Line 2?  \nNo\u2014same point.\n\nWait\u2014no. The lines are **parallel**, but **not the same**.\n\nBut they **overlap** from (1,1) to (3,3).\n\nSo the **shortest distance** between the lines is **zero**\u2014because they **overlap**.\n\nSo the **minimum distance** between the two lines is **0**.\n\nSo the **optimal segment** is any segment connecting a point on Line 1 to a point on Line 2.\n\nBut to minimize the **maximum distance** from any point on either line to the segment, the best choice is to connect the **midpoints** of the **overlap**.\n\nSo connect (2,2) on Line 1 to (2,2) on Line 2.\n\nBut that\u2019s the same point.\n\nSo the segment is just a point.\n\nBut that\u2019s not a segment.\n\nWait\u2014no. We can connect (2,2) on Line 1 to (2,2) on Line 2.\n\nBut it\u2019s the same point.\n\nSo the segment is degenerate.\n\nBut we can connect (2,2) on Line 1 to (2,2) on Line 2.\n\nBut it\u2019s the same point.\n\nSo the **optimal segment** is **any segment** that connects a point on Line 1 to a point on Line 2, and is **perpendicular** to the lines.\n\nBut since the lines overlap, the **best** is to connect the **midpoint of the overlap** to itself.\n\nBut that\u2019s not a segment.\n\nSo the **optimal segment** is the one that is **perpendicular** and **centered** on the overlap.\n\nSo connect (2,2) on Line 1 to (2,2) on Line 2.\n\nBut it\u2019s the same point.\n\nSo the segment is just a point.\n\nBut that\u2019s not a segment.\n\nSo the **optimal segment** is the one that is

 \n  - Boy A \u2192 Girl B  \n  - Boy B \u2192 Girl A  \n  - YES.\n\nSo even if all names are shared, it\u2019s possible.\n\nBut what if:\n- N = 2 boys: A A  \n- M = 2 girls: A A  \n- But names are *distinct*?

So the task likely means: **Which of the candidate words best fits the context of the sentence, as if it were the missing word?**  \nBut the sentence already makes perfect sense as is. So perhaps the real task is to **choose the word that best fits the meaning of \u201cturned up unannounced\u201d**\u2014i.e., which of these words is most likely to be associated with an unannounced visit?\n\nLet\u2019s examine the candidates:\n\n1. **appointment**  \n   - An appointment is a scheduled meeting.  \n   - \u201cTurned up unannounced\u201d contradicts the idea of an appointment, which is planned.  \n   - So this doesn\u2019t fit.\n\n2. **solicitation**  \n   - This refers to the act of asking for something, often money or support, typically in a formal or persistent way.  \n   - It\u2019s not something you \u201cturn up\u201d for.  \n   - \u201cTurned up at my door unannounced\u201d for a solicitation? Possible, but not idiomatic.  \n   - It\u2019s a stretch.\n\n3. **meeting**  \n   - A meeting is an arranged gathering.  \n   - \u201cTurned up unannounced\u201d implies it was *not* arranged.  \n   - So this also contradicts the idea of a meeting.\n\nWait\u2014none of the words fit the sentence *as a replacement* for \u201cturned up\u201d or as a noun that fits after \u201cat my door\u201d.\n\nBut perhaps the sentence is meant to be:  \n*PersonX turned up at my door for a(n) ______ last night.*  \nAnd we are to fill in the blank with one of the candidates.\n\nThat makes more sense.\n\nSo rephrased:  \n*PersonX turned up at my door for a(n) ______ last night.*  \nNow, which word fits?\n\n- **appointment** \u2192 \u201cfor an appointment\u201d \u2192 but \u201cunannounced\u201d contradicts \u201cappointment\u201d (which is scheduled).  \n- **solicitation** \u2192 \u201cfor a solicitation\u201d \u2192 possible, but not common.  \n- **meeting** \u2192 \u201cfor a meeting\u201d \u2192 again, \u201cunannounced\u201d contradicts \u201cmeeting\u201d.\n\nBut the original sentence says \u201cunannounced\u201d, so the event was *not* planned.\n\nSo none of the words fit *if* the event was unannounced.\n\nBut perhaps the task is to find the word that is *most likely* to be associated with an unannounced visit.\n\nLet\u2019s think:  \n- A person turning up unannounced could be for a **meeting** (if it\u2019s a surprise meeting), but that\u2019s rare.  \n- **Solicitation**? Yes\u2014someone might show up unannounced to solicit donations.  \n- **Appointment**? No\u2014by definition, an appointment is scheduled.\n\nSo **solicitation** is the only one that *can* be unannounced.\n\nBut the sentence says \u201cturned up at my door unannounced last night\u201d \u2014 it doesn\u2019t say *for what*. So the word should be something that *can* be unannounced.\n\nAmong the three, **solicitation** is the only one that is commonly associated with unannounced visits (e.g., door-to-door salespeople).\n\nTherefore, **solicitation** is the best fit.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the sentence doesn\u2019t have a blank. So perhaps the task is to **replace \u201cturned up\u201d** with one of the candidates? That doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sentence is:  \n*PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night for a(n) ______.*  \nAnd we are to choose the correct word.\n\nIn that case, **solicitation** is the only one that fits.\n\nBut let\u2019s check the original:  \n> Sentence: PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night.<sep>Candidates: ['appointment', 'solicitation', 'meeting']\n\nNo blank. So perhaps the task is to **choose the word that best fits the context** \u2014 i.e., which of these words is most likely to be the *reason* for the unannounced visit?\n\nThen:\n\n- **appointment** \u2192 no, because it\u2019s scheduled.\n- **meeting** \u2192 same, usually scheduled.\n- **solicitation** \u2192 yes, often unannounced.\n\nSo **solicitation** is the only one that fits.\n\nThus, the correct word is **solicitation**.\n\nNow, the task asks for the **index** of the correct word in the list.\n\nList:  \n0.

The keyword \"calendar\" links both sentences thematically, making them about the same general idea: using a calendar to keep track of time, especially when digital tools aren\u2019t available.\n\n\u2705 **Answer: Yes**.", "Let's carefully analyze the scenario step by step.\n\n### Given:\n- There are **three cash registers**.\n- Each register can serve **only one customer at a time**.\n- There is **no limit on the number of items** a customer can buy \u2014 so service time depends on the **customer\u2019s transaction**, not the number of items.\n- **Register 1 opens at 8:00 am**.\n- **Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available** \u2014 this is key.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the phrasing is a bit ambiguous. Let's clarify:\n\n> \"Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis likely means:  \n- Register 2 opens **when Register 1 becomes free**.  \n- Register 3 opens **when Register 2 becomes free**.\n\nBut we are not told **how long each customer takes**. That\u2019s a problem.\n\nHowever, the question is:  \n> \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, when will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?\"\n\nSo we know:\n- At 8:30 am, **all three registers are busy**.\n- A **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**.\n- The fourth customer must wait until **one of the three registers becomes free**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know **when** the current customers will finish.\n\nWait \u2014 but the key is in the **opening rule**:  \n> \"Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis suggests that the **registers are opened sequentially**, based on the **availability of the prior register**.\n\nBut we are not told **when** the first customer finishes.\n\nSo how can we answer?\n\nLet\u2019s re-read:  \n> \"The first register opens at 8:00 am, and subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis implies that:\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2 opens when Register 1 becomes free.\n- Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes free.\n\nBut we are not told **how long** the first customer takes.\n\nBut the question says:  \n> \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am...\"\n\nSo at 8:30 am, **all three are busy**.\n\nBut we need to know **when** the **first** customer (who started at 8:00 am) finishes.\n\nBut we don\u2019t have that.\n\nWait \u2014 unless we assume that **each customer takes the same amount of time**, and that **the registers open sequentially**.\n\nBut the only way this question can be answered is if we assume that **each customer takes 15 minutes**.\n\nWhy? Because the answer choices are in 15-minute increments: 8:35, 8:45, 9:00, 9:15.\n\nAnd the only way the logic works is if **each customer takes 15 minutes**.\n\nLet\u2019s test that.\n\n---\n\n### Assumption: Each customer takes **15 minutes** to serve.\n\n- **8:00 am**: Register 1 opens. First customer starts.\n- **8:15 am**: First customer finishes. Register 2 opens.\n- **8:30 am**: Second customer finishes. Register 3 opens.\n\nWait \u2014 but the second customer started at 8:15 am, so finishes at 8:30 am.\n\nSo at **8:30 am**, **Register 3 opens**.\n\nBut the question says:  \n> \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am...\"\n\nSo at 8:30 am, **all three registers are still in use** \u2014 meaning **the third customer is still being served**.\n\nBut if the third customer started at 8:30 am, then they just started \u2014 so they are not finished.\n\nBut the **third register opened at 8:30 am**, so the **third customer started at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: customer started at 8:00 am \u2192 finishes at 8:15 am \u2192 **already free**.\n- Register 2: customer started at 8:15 am \u2192 finishes at 8:30 am \u2192 **just finished**.\n- Register 3: customer started at 8:30 am \u2192 **just started**.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, **Register 1 and 2 are free**, but **Register 3 is in use**.\n\nBut the question says: **\"all three registers are in use\"** at 8:30 am.\n\nSo that contradicts our assumption.\n\nSo if all three are in use at 8:30 am, then **Register 1 and 2 must still be busy**.\n\nSo the first customer must have taken **longer than 15 minutes**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long.\n\nWait \u2014 unless the **registers open sequentially**, but **the first customer takes 30 minutes**.\n\nLet\u2019s try:\n\n- **8:00 am**: Register 1 opens. First customer starts.\n- **8:30 am**: First customer finishes. Register 2 opens.\n- **8:30 am**: Second customer starts at Register 2.\n- **8:30 am**: Third customer starts at Register 3? But Register 3 hasn\u2019t opened yet.\n\nWait \u2014 Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes available.\n\nSo:\n- Register 1: opens at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2: opens when Register 1 becomes free.\n- Register 3: opens when Register 2 becomes free.\n\nSo if the first customer takes **30 minutes**, then:\n- **8:00 am**: Register 1 opens. Customer 1 starts.\n- **8:30 am**: Customer 1 finishes. Register 2 opens.\n- **8:30 am**: Customer 2 starts at Register 2.\n- **9:00 am**: Customer 2 finishes. Register 3 opens.\n- **9:00 am**: Customer 3 starts at Register 3.\n\nBut the question says: **\"all three registers are in use\" at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: busy (customer 1 until 8:30)\n- Register 2: just opened at 8:30 \u2192 customer 2 starts at 8:30\n- Register 3: not open yet \u2192 not in use\n\nSo only **two registers** are in use at 8:30 am.\n\nBut the question says **all three are in use**.\n\nSo that doesn\u2019t work.\n\nSo the only way **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am** is if **Register 3 opened before 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Register 2 must have become free **before 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Register 1 must have become free **before 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the first customer must have finished **before 8:30 am**.\n\nBut then Register 2 opened before 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 3 opened when Register 2 became free.\n\nSo if Register 2 became free at, say, 8:15 am, then Register 3 opened at 8:15 am.\n\nThen if the second customer started at 8:15 am, and took 15 minutes, they finish at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 3 opens at 8:15 am, and the third customer starts at 8:15 am, finishes at 8:30 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free (finished at 8:00 + 30 min = 8:30)\n- Register 2: free (finished at 8:30)\n- Register 3: free (finished at 8:30)\n\nSo all three are free at 8:30 am.\n\nBut the question says **all three are in use** at 8:30 am.\n\nSo that doesn\u2019t work.\n\nWait \u2014 unless the **first customer takes 45 minutes**.\n\nLet\u2019s try:\n\n- **8:00 am**: Register 1 opens. Customer 1 starts.\n- **8:45 am**: Customer 1 finishes. Register 2 opens.\n- **8:45 am**: Customer 2 starts at Register 2.\n- **9:00 am**: Customer 2 finishes. Register 3 opens.\n- **9:00 am**: Customer 3 starts at Register 3.\n\nBut at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: busy (until 8:45)\n- Register 2: not open yet\n- Register 3: not open yet\n\nSo only **one register** in use.\n\nNot all three.\n\nSo that doesn\u2019t work.\n\nWait \u2014 the only way **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am** is if **Register 3 opened before 8:30 am**, and **all three customers are still being served**.\n\nSo the **first customer** must have started **before 8:00 am**? But no \u2014 Register 1 opens at 8:00 am.\n\nSo the **first customer** starts at 8:00 am.\n\nThen Register 2 opens when Register 1 becomes free.\n\nRegister 3 opens when Register 2 becomes free.\n\nSo for all three to be in use at 8:30 am, the **third customer must have started before 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Register 3 must have opened before 8:30 am.\n\nSo Register 2 must have become free before 8:30 am.\n\nSo Register 1 must have become free before 8:30 am.\n\nSo the first customer must have finished **before 8:30 am**.\n\nBut then Register 2 opened before 8:30 am.\n\nThen the second customer started before 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 3 opened when Register 2 became free.\n\nSo if the second customer took 15 minutes, and started at 8:15 am, they finish at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 3 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nThen the third customer starts at 8:30 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free (finished at 8:15 am)\n- Register 2: free (finished at 8:30 am)\n- Register 3: just opened, customer starts\n\nSo only **one register** in use.\n\nNot all three.\n\nSo the only way all three are in use at 8:30 am is if **the third customer started before 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Register 3 must have opened before 8:30 am.\n\nSo Register 2 must have become free before 8:30 am.\n\nSo Register 1 must have become free before 8:30 am.\n\nSo the first customer must have finished before 8:30 am.\n\nBut then Register 2 opened before 8:30 am.\n\nThen the second customer started before 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 3 opened when Register 2 became free.\n\nSo if the second customer took 30 minutes, and started at 8:00 am, they finish at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 3 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nThen the third customer starts at 8:30 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free (finished at 8:00 + 30 = 8:30)\n- Register 2: free (finished at 8:30)\n- Register 3: just opened\n\nSo only one in use.\n\nStill not all three.\n\nWait \u2014 unless the **first customer took 30 minutes**, so finishes at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nThen the second customer starts at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes free.\n\nSo if the second customer takes 30 minutes, they finish at 9:00 am.\n\nThen Register 3 opens at 9:00 am.\n\nThen the third customer starts at 9:00 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: busy (until 8:30)\n- Register 2: just opened, customer starts\n- Register 3: not open\n\nSo only two in use.\n\nNot all three.\n\nSo the only way all three are in use at 8:30 am is if **Register 3 opened before 8:30 am**, and **the third customer started before 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Register 2 must have become free before 8:30 am.\n\nSo Register 1 must have become free before 8:30 am.\n\nSo the first customer must have finished before 8:30 am.\n\nBut then Register 2 opened before 8:30 am.\n\nThen the second customer started before 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 3 opened when Register 2 became free.\n\nSo if the second customer took 15 minutes, and started at 8:15 am, they finish at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 3 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nThen the third customer starts at 8:30 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free (finished at 8:15)\n- Register 2: free (finished at 8:30)\n- Register 3: just opened\n\nSo only one in use.\n\nStill not all three.\n\nWait \u2014 unless the **first customer took 45 minutes**, so finishes at 8:45 am.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:45 am.\n\nThen the second customer starts at 8:45 am.\n\nThen Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes free.\n\nSo if the second customer takes 15 minutes, they finish at 9:00 am.\n\nThen Register 3 opens at 9:00 am.\n\nThen the third customer starts at 9:00 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: busy (until 8:45)\n- Register 2: not open\n- Register 3: not open\n\nSo only one in use.\n\nNot all three.\n\nSo the only way all three are in use at 8:30 am is if **the first customer started at 8:00 am and takes 30 minutes**, so finishes at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nThen the second customer starts at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes free.\n\nSo if the second customer takes 30 minutes, they finish at 9:00 am.\n\nThen Register 3 opens at 9:00 am.\n\nThen the third customer starts at 9:00 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: busy (until 8:30)\n- Register 2: just opened, customer starts\n- Register 3: not open\n\nSo only two in use.\n\nNot all three.\n\nSo the only way all three are in use at 8:30 am is if **Register 3 opened before 8:30 am**, and **the third customer started before 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Register 2 must have become free before 8:30 am.\n\nSo Register 1 must have become free before 8:30 am.\n\nSo the first customer must have finished before 8:30 am.\n\nBut then Register 2 opened before 8:30 am.\n\nThen the second customer started before 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 3 opened when Register 2 became free.\n\nSo if the second customer took 15 minutes, and started at 8:15 am, they finish at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 3 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nThen the third customer starts at 8:30 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free (finished at 8:15)\n- Register 2: free (finished at 8:30)\n- Register 3: just opened\n\nSo only one in use.\n\nSo it's impossible for all three to be in use at 8:30 am unless the first customer took 45 minutes, and the second took 30 minutes, and the third took 15 minutes, and they all started at 8:00 am.\n\nBut that's not possible because the registers open sequentially.\n\nThe only way is if the first customer took 30 minutes, so finishes at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nThen the second customer starts at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes free.\n\nSo if the second customer takes 30 minutes, they finish at 9:00 am.\n\nThen Register 3 opens at 9:00 am.\n\nThen the third customer starts at 9:00 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: busy (until 8:30)\n- Register 2: just opened, customer starts\n- Register 3: not open\n\nSo only two in use.\n\nSo the only way all three are in use at 8:30 am is if the third customer started before 8:30 am.\n\nSo Register 3 must have opened before 8:30 am.\n\nSo Register 2 must have become

opens at 8:30 am.\n\nThen the third customer starts at 8:30 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free (finished at 8:15)\n- Register 2: free (finished at 8:30)\n- Register 3: just opened\n\nSo only one in use.\n\nSo it's impossible.\n\nUnless the first customer took 30 minutes, so finishes at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nThen the second customer starts at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes free.\n\nSo if the second customer takes 30 minutes, they finish at 9:00 am.\n\nThen Register 3 opens at 9:00 am.\n\nThen the third customer starts at 9:00

am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free (finished at 8:15)\n- Register 2: free (finished at 8:30)\n- Register 3: just opened\n\nSo only one in use.\n\nSo it's impossible.\n\nUnless the first
